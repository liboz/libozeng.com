<blurb>The mystery of .NET's ping implementation on Linux</blurb>

<p>
  Because I'm frequently annoyed by internet disconnects, a few years back I
  wrote a F# console app that would send an ICMP ping to selected targets every
  500ms. Recently, I decided to modernize it to .NET Core, Dockerize it, and run
  it on a Linux box. I mostly did my development in WSL (Windows Subsystem for
  Linux). I encountered some very odd issues and I'll describe what happened.
</p>

<p>
  Running the console app locally in Windows had been fine and remained without
  any issues at all. However, when I attempted to run my app in WSL 2 via
  Docker, I quickly ran into an issue. Even when pings were being sent without
  any timeouts at all in Windows, running it in Linux would after ~2-3s result
  in over half the pings returning a timeout. This behavior made it so that the
  app was effectively useless in Linux. I suspect there was some rate limit that
  started to block my app after a few seconds due to the relatively rapid pings.
  There was some odd bug in Linux.
</p>

<p>
  My first guess as to the reason behind this bug was that WSL was simply not
  quite the same as an actual Linux machine and maybe pinging just didn't work
  perfectly. I've encountered WSL behaving weirdly before, so it's not that
  unexpected. To test this, I used a VM in DigitalOcean to run my app. No issue
  at all!
</p>

<p>
  So, it wasn't an issue with all Linux systems. Just with my Linux system. My
  next step was to use a non-.NET based ping utility and try my luck. Using the
  standard ping tool, I ran
  <code>ping google.com -i 0.05</code> on my WSL instance.
</p>

<p>
  The result was 0 timeouts. The behavior was completely different from my .NET
  based ping utility. Okay, so now I know that some ping implementations would
  work in WSL, just not the .NET one. The next step was to figure out why only
  approximately 50% of the pings in my .NET utility returned timeouts in WSL. I
  started reading the
  <a href="https://github.com/.NET/corefx/pull/4484">source code</a> of the .NET
  implementation of <i>SendPingAsync</i>. I saw that it set up raw sockets for
  each ICMP ping it sent. Because of this, I thought that perhaps there was
  buildup in sockets in WSL. As far as I could tell with things like
  <i>lsof</i> there was nothing weird happening. So, I set up strace and looked
  around for system calls where sockets were being used. I spent a few hours
  doing this, but... honestly there didn't appear to be any system call
  differences between ping attempts that worked and ping attempts that failed.
  It seemed like randomly half of the calls would simply fail for no discernible
  reason.
</p>

<p>
  Since the app worked fine on DigitalOcean's Linux VM, I was fairly confident
  that it was some WSL issue. So, I set up a local Linux box and hope it would
  work. Sadly, the local Linux box (non-VM) also experienced the same issue with
  the same behavior. I guess it wasn't WSL after all.
</p>

<p>
  I was pretty stumped. I started poking around my router settings for unrelated
  reasons and stumbled upon a security log. In there, I discovered the following
  logs (slightly modified).
</p>

<pre><code>1 	Jan 22 04:06:02 	kern 	alert 	attack 	kernel: PING OF DEATH ATTACK:SRC=192.0.2.0 DST=142.250.80.14 LEN=60 TOS=0x00 PREC=0x00 TTL=62 ID=41216 PROTO=ICMP TYPE=8 CODE=0 ID=64839 SEQ=0

<p>
  Oh! My own router was blocking my pings because it thought I was an attacker.
  But why would it only block pings on Linux and only pings in the .NET
  implementation? .NET on Windows worked completely fine and the standard
  <i>ping</i> utility in Linux worked fine too. This was very confusing, but I
  finally felt like I had a lead on something.
</p>

<p>
  I downloaded <a href="https://www.wireshark.org/">Wireshark</a> and started
  listening to my network interface, filtering for ICMP pings. While doing that
  I also ran my .NET app on Windows and looked at all the parameters. Then, I
  did the same in Linux and in Linux with the <i>ping</i> utility.
</p>

<p>
  It turns out the main difference is in how the ID and Sequence Number are used
  by the various implementations. Those two properties are used in the following
  way according to the
  <a href="https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc792">spec</a>:
</p>

<pre><code>Identifier

      If code = 0, an identifier to aid in matching echos and replies,
      may be zero.

Sequence Number

      If code = 0, a sequence number to aid in matching echos and
      replies, may be zero.</code></pre>

<p>
  It seems that should be able to be used in the same way. Here's a table
  showing how the various ping implementations differ in their usage of ID and
  Sequence Number.
</p>

<table>
  <tr>
    <th></th>
    <th>Identifier</th>
    <th>Sequence Number</th>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Linux <i>ping</i> CLI</td>
    <td>Constant</td>
    <td>Incrementing</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Windows ICMP system call</td>
    <td>Constant</td>
    <td>Incrementing</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>.NET <i>SendPingAsync</i> in Linux</td>
    <td>Incrementing</td>
    <td>Constant</td>
  </tr>
</table>

<p>
  At this point, I downloaded the
  <a href="https://github.com/go-ping/ping">go-ping</a> library, modified it to
  control the incrementing myself to test what happens with my router. I
  discovered that an <b><i>incrementing identifier</i></b> was what would cause
  my router to think it is a <i>Ping of Death</i> attack.
</p>

<p>
  I now wanted to know why .NET chose to implement ping in this way that
  differed in behavior from these other pingers. Digging into github, the reason
  for this divergence appears to be to mimic Mono's implementation of
  <i>SendPingAsync</i> (See discussion
  <a href="https://github.com/.NET/runtime/issues/18933">here</a>
  and the
  <a
    href="https://github.com/mono/mono/blob/8994ce8a09a101e7965a820ed7dc148d9685f89f/mcs/class/System/System.Net.NetworkInformation/Ping.cs#L254"

    >code parts</a
  >.) I'm not sure why Mono was implemented in this manner, but I guess that's
  what caused all this pain.
</p>

<p>
  Armed with this knowledge, I realized making my own manual ping implementation
  was likely too painful in .NET as I'd have to use unsafe code. I ported my app
  entirely to golang and called it a day. I learned about raw sockets and how to
  use strace and wireshark, but I do wish I could have been spared this pain. I
  suppose that's the price of learning.
