I investigate into why a local DNS server was being deprioritized compare to
public DNS servers on Android in Private DNS's Opportunistic mode.

<h2 id="intro">Intro</h2>
<p>
  In 2022, I set up a local DNS server so I could try out blocking ads on the
  DNS level with something like pihole. I changed my DHCP server to point to
  this server (using an IP address like 192.168.1.225) as the primary DNS server
  and for redundancy I kept Google's Public DNS server 8.8.8.8. as the secondary
  DNS. That way I could restart my machine without any issues. Things were
  great. I was able to see devices connect to my new local DNS server and see
  ads blocked on the DNS level.
</p>

<p>
  However, I eventually noticed my Android devices would curiously ignore my DNS
  server. After a little investigation, I realized that Android has something
  called "Private DNS".

<p>
  By default, Android has Private DNS in the "automatic" aka
  <b><i>Opportunistic</i></b> mode.
</p>

<blockquote>
  With the opportunistic privacy profile, the DNS server IP address may be
  configured directly by the user or obtained from the local network (using DHCP
  or some other means). The client resolver attempts to establish a secure
  connection on port 853 to the specified DNS server. If a secure connection is
  established, this provides privacy for the user's queries from passive
  observers on the path. Since the client does not verify the authenticity of
  the server it is not protected from an active attacker. If the client cannot
  establish a secure connection on port 853, it falls back to communicating with
  the DNS server on the standard DNS port 53 over UDP or TCP without any
  security or privacy. The use of Opportunistic Privacy is intended to support
  incremental deployment of increased privacy with a view to widespread adoption
  of the strict privacy profile.

<h2 id="setup">Setting up DNS-over-TLS (DoT)</h2>
<p>
  Since I didn't have DNS-over-TLS (DoT) set up, it would go to the secondary
  DNS server of 8.8.8.8, which does have DoT set up. I configured my DNS server
  to accept DoT connections and got a certificate. Since the authenticity of the
  server is not supposed to be validated, I assumed a generic cert from Let's
  Encrypt would get the job done. Unfortunately, by default, Let's Encrypt uses
  a certificate chain cross signed with an expired root certificate (for more
  background see
  <a href="https://karlquinsland.com/skyhole-expired-lets-encrypt-ca/">these</a>
  <a href="https://ikarus.sg/lets-encrypt-dot-android/">blog</a>
  <a
    href="https://blog.jeroenhd.nl/article/let-s-encrypt-dns-over-tls-and-android"
    >posts</a
  >). Android rejects this immediately upon seeing it. The solution is to
  regenerate the cert using "ISRG Root X1" as the preferred issuer.
</p>

<p>
  After confirming my DoT server was set up with the right certs and could
  respond correctly to the 853 port via
  <a href="https://www.knot-dns.cz/docs/2.6/html/man_kdig.html"><i>kdig</i></a
  >, I tried again with my Android devices. Still no good. Only a very small
  number of regular DNS requests were made to my local DNS server, likely for
  bootstrapping. The majority of requests when browsing were going to Google's
  Public DNS (8.8.8.8). I assumed I had another configuration issue of some
  sort. To confirm, I temporarily changed my DHCP server to only have my local
  DNS server. Surprisingly, this worked and all the requests were indeed being
  sent via DoT to my local DNS server.

      >But, when there were 2 servers in my DHCP, why did my local server get
      deprioritized compared to 8.8.8.8?</i

</p>

<h2 id="debugging">Debugging Private DNS Priority</h2>
<p>
  My first guess was there was some special casing for Google's Public DNS by
  Android since they are both Google products. I then tried using some other
  Public DNS servers like Cloudflare's 1.1.1.1 and OpenDNS's 208.67.222.222. I
  saw the same behavior where my server was always being deprioritized compared
  to these public DNS servers. Given the wide variety of servers I tried, I felt
  like it was unlikely to be special casing by Android. I scoured the web for if
  someone had dug into this and written up an explanation, but I didn't find
  anything.
</p>

<p>
  At this point, I had no other leads so I started looking at the Android source
  code to try to figure out the mystery. I found
  <a
    href="https://cs.android.com/android/platform/superproject/+/master:packages/modules/DnsResolver/"
    >the main folder</a
  >
  for DNS resolution related code and started digging. I found a function called
  <a
    href="https://cs.android.com/android/platform/superproject/+/master:packages/modules/DnsResolver/res_send.cpp;drc=c84b0fbdfc0d221806c14170fb4197cfc2b9b035;l=1421"
    ><i>res_tls_send</i></a
  >, which does the DNS query over TLS. I then found
  <a
    href="https://cs.android.com/android/platform/superproject/+/master:packages/modules/DnsResolver/DnsTlsDispatcher.cpp;drc=2bee933745b9e13d7bae6ba429ae16cf33a6373b;l=51"
    ><i>DnsTlsDispatcher::getOrderedAndUsableServerList</i></a
  >, which stated a sorted ordering.
</p>
<pre>
<code>    // Our preferred DnsTlsServer order is:
    //     1) reuse existing IPv6 connections
    //     2) reuse existing IPv4 connections
    //     3) establish new IPv6 connections
    //     4) establish new IPv4 connections
</code></pre>

<p>
  However, I didn't think any of the sorted differences applied since all the
  addresses were IPv4 and the existence of the connection wouldn't differ
  between a well known public DNS and my own local DNS server after rebooting my
  Android device. In that case, the ordering would just be the order of the list
  of tlsServers that was passed in. That ordering comes from a function called
  <a
    href="https://cs.android.com/android/platform/superproject/+/master:packages/modules/DnsResolver/PrivateDnsConfiguration.h;drc=04a8b1a8f8864b00c319d00adbe719db9b8418fb;l=53"
    ><i>validatedServers</i></a
  >. The ordering thus comes a <i>std::map</i> called
  <a
    href="https://cs.android.com/android/platform/superproject/+/master:packages/modules/DnsResolver/PrivateDnsConfiguration.h;drc=04a8b1a8f8864b00c319d00adbe719db9b8418fb;l=49"
    >dotServersMap</a
  >
  sorting based on the
  <a
    href="https://cs.android.com/android/platform/superproject/+/master:bionic/libc/include/bits/in_addr.h;drc=04a8b1a8f8864b00c319d00adbe719db9b8418fb;l=40"
    >32-bit integer</a
  >
  representing an
  <a
    href="https://cs.android.com/android/platform/superproject/+/master:packages/modules/DnsResolver/DnsTlsServer.cpp;l=102;drc=4499ee36eea0bdc498ff669ae2ecd706d5702ce2"
    >IP Address</a
  >.
</p>

<p>
  In that case, my local DNS server's IP of 192.168.1.225 would correspond to
  3232261089. And 8.8.8.8 would correspond to 134744072, which is smaller. That
  would explain the reason why 8.8.8.8 is prioritized. OpenDNS's 208.67.222.222
  would correspond to 3494108894, which is larger than my local server's IP.
  Despite that, OpenDNS was being prioritized compared to my local DNS.
</p>

<p>
  After staring at the code a ton, I realized with my limited C++ and Android
  internals knowledge, I probably wasn't going to get too much further without
  running some code. I compiled Android's DnsResolver code, added some logging,
  and ran some unit tests. With that I was able to find out that the actual
  integer values used in the <i>std::map</i> corresponding to 192.168.1.225,
  8.8.8.8, and 208.67.222.222 were 3774982336, 134744072, and 3739108304
  respectively. So my local IP address in practice was indeed larger than the
  public DNSes. Google's public DNS matched my calculated values, but the other
  IP addreses didn't. I wasn't able to figure out why the numbers differed from
  what I expected, but my brother who is more proficient in C++ was able to
  deduce that the reason for this. IP Addresses are represented in
  <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Endianness#Networking"
    >big endian order</a
  >
  aka <b><i>network byte order</i></b
  >. But, my ARM processor had the value stored in little endian order. Thus,
  the values were reversed, which explains the difference in the integer values.
</p>

<p>
  Since the value of the bytes were being reversed, I just needed to make sure
  that the lowest byte for my local DNS server was lower than the lowest byte of
  the public DNS server I used. Thus, I switched the IP of my local DNS server
  to 192.168.1.4 which would have an integer representation as 67217600, less
  than Google's Public DNS. Using 192.168.1.4 and OpenDNS's 208.67.222.222, I
  was finally able to get the expected behavior where my local DNS server was
  prioritized. Yet, using Google's 8.8.8.8 would still prioritize Google's
  server over my own.
</p>

<p>
  At this point, I was truly stumped. Luckily, looking at the history of the Git
  commits to Android, I was able to find the contact for one of the people who
  wrote this networking code. I asked this person and they explained the
  situation in about 5 minutes. It turns out there is
  <a
    href="https://cs.android.com/android/platform/superproject/+/master:packages/modules/DnsResolver/PrivateDnsConfiguration.h;l=250-252;drc=4c80818efc71774b662aa3167d03cf49b1266909"
    >special casing</a
  >
  for Google's 8.8.8.8 after all! This special casing would make 8.8.8.8
  automatically be categorized as a DoH (DNS-over-HTTPS) server. Then, in the
  code right before
  <i>res_tls_send</i> was called, there is a
  <a
    href="https://cs.android.com/android/platform/superproject/+/master:packages/modules/DnsResolver/res_send.cpp;drc=c84b0fbdfc0d221806c14170fb4197cfc2b9b035;l=1330-1333"
    >conditional
  </a>
  that checks if there are DoH servers available. If DoH servers are available,
  it queries using the DoH servers instead of using DoT!
</p>

<p>
  This investigation took months and I was frequently out of my depth, but I'm
  glad to have finally figured out most of the points of confusion. Because I
  only want to use a public DNS as a backup in case my local DNS fails, I
  unfortunately can't use 8.8.8.8 due to the prioritization. I also can't use
  Cloudflare's 1.1.1.1 because it's really hard to get a lower integer
  representation as that without changing my subnet. I just picked another
  public DNS and I now finally have the setup I want. It was a long journey.
