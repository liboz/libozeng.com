<p>
  Whether to stay in the European Union (EU) or to leave it. I hope that the
  British people will finally put an end to this turmoil with the election.
</p>
<p>
  The House of Commons voted overwhelmingly (438-20) to have a general election
  on December 12th. This means they will be able to avoid the no-deal Brexit
  that was set to occur at the end of October.
</p>

<p></p>
<p>
  Whether or not to leave the EU with a new Brexit deal will be the main focus
  of the election. The Conservative Party, which is in power at the moment, and
  the largest opposition party, the Labor Party, are at odds on this issue. With
  pro and anti-Brexit factions contesting this election, the votes of citizens
  will be very varied.
</p>
<p>
  The United Kingdom Parliament has been unable to reach an agreement on a
  specific Brexit plan even three years and four months after the 2016
  referendum on this issue. Once it was agreed on to hold the general election,
  Prime Minister Johnson says that "now is the time to unify Britain and make
  Brexit a reality."
</p>
<p>
  Even though Mr. Johnson entered office willing to go through with a no-deal
  Brexit, he made a sudden about-face on the 17th and assembled a new Brexit
  plan with the EU. However, many members of the opposition Party were opposed
  to it and demanded that the Prime Minister request an extension from the EU.
</p>
<p>
  Having successfully assembled a new Brexit plan, the Prime Minister intends to
  break the deadlock of having a minority government by having a general
  election. If they win and then get it through Parliament, that would open the
  path to even completing Brexit in 2019.
</p>
<p>
  In recent opinion polls, Mr. Johnson's Conservative Party holds a superior
  position over the Labor Party with a 10-15 point. However, the Brexit Party,
  advocates of a hard Brexit, is gaining ground, and thus the lead that the
  Conservatives posses cannot be said to be rock solid.
</p>
<p>
  The opposition Labor Party lacks cohesion. Party leader Corbin states that he
  has an "ambitious" electoral strategy under the banner of the Remain side. If
  they will in the general election they will once again hold a general
  referendum on Brexit. However, two years ago the same party made a public
  commitment to Brexit. Even now, the party still grapples with soft Brexiters
  who say that as long as the UK remains in the EU customs union, Brexit won't
  be a problem.
</p>
<p>
  If the general election in December results in the decision to leave the EU,
  the United Kingdom will have to immediately grapple with the next big problem.
  They have begun negotiations with the EU with regards to a free trade
  agreement for a transition period to smooth out the Brexit process.
</p>
<p>
  The British government intends to also conclude free trade agreements with
  other countries such as Japan and America. It paints the picture of a "Global
  Britain" which will have many economic opportunities even outside Europe.
</p>
<p>
  If the UK leaves the EU, Japan should quickly conclude a free trade agreement
  with the UK and include the UK in the Trans-Pacific Partnership (TPP).
