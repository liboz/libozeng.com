<p>
  I recently went skiing at a number of places in Japan in Honshu and I just
  wanted to write down some thoughts I had about the ease of public transit and
  the fastest route to each place. The assumption is that you're starting from
  Tokyo station.

<h2 id="hakuba">Hakuba Happo</h2>
<ul>
  <li>
    Shinkansen: Tokyo → Nagano

      <li>
        Buy tickets at automated vending machine in JR's みどりの窓口 inside
        Nagano station. Return trip can buy tickets at the Happo Bus Terminal.
      </li>
      <li>Lots of space for ski stuff</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>
    Shuttle Bus: Happo Bus Terminal to Lifts
    <ul>
      <li>~10min. <b>FREE!</b></li>
      <li>
        Bus is not that regular. Can be very crowded and hard to place stuff.
      </li>
      <li>
        Alternative is to walk ~1km (~15 min). Mostly flat, minor elevation
        change
      </li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Total cost: 11140 jpy one way</li>
  <li>
    Earliest arrival time: ~9:30
    <ul>
      <li>
        6:16 departure from Tokyo on Kagayaki 501. Arrive at Nagano at 7:36
      </li>
      <li>Take 7:55 bus from Nagano and arrive at Happo at 9:10</li>
      <li>
        15 minute walk, if lucky can take one of the extra shuttle buses [next
        regularly scheduled bus is 9:30]
      </li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>
    Alternative Route (Bus from Shinjuku. Have not tested)
    <ul>
      <li>
        ~7.5 hours. 6400-7800 jpy one way depending on the day of week/date

      <li>
        23:05 departure from Shinjuku, 6:32 arrival at Happo Bus Terminal. First
        lift at 8:00
      </li>
      <li>7:35 depature from Shinjuku, 12:48 arrival at Happo Bus Terminal</li>
      <li>Pros: Quite a bit cheaper. Can arrive before first lift</li>
      <li>
        Cons: 7.5 hour bus ride at night means probably will be poorly rested.
        Arrive too early compared to lift start time.

      </li>
      <li>
        <b>Limited space for Ski Equipment</b>. The return trip in particular
        had the bus at max capacity as we arrived near Nagano station (this was
        a weekday). May not be an issue if sending equipment via delivery.

        Nagano as well)

<h2 id="thoughts">Thoughts</h2>
<p>
  Just some thoughts about ease of access overall. I felt getting to Geto was
  extremely convenient and I saved a lot by being able to stay in Kitakami
  instead of near the ski resort (5k-8k JPY a night instead of 10k-15k). This
  might make up the difference in cost in Shinkansen transit fare. Madarao's bus
  fare was also cheaper and more convenient so that might be a reasonable
  strategy there too, especially since Iiyama is relatively cheap too.
  Meanwhile, stuff near Nagano Station is not too much cheaper than stuff near
  the resorts especially if one considers the round trip bus cost. Lastly,
  Tazawako's uphill climb after the bus stop was truly awful.
</p>
<p>I might update this in the future. Will likely update the dates too.</p>
