<p>
  I recently went skiing at a number of places in Japan in Honshu and I just
  wanted to write down some thoughts I had about the ease of public transit and
  the fastest route to each place. The assumption is that you're starting from
  Tokyo station. <i>Minor update (2024/04/14):</i> Added Gala Yuzawa.

    <ul>
      <li>~10min. <b>FREE!</b></li>
      <li>
        Bus is not that regular. Can be very crowded and hard to place stuff.
      </li>
      <li>
        Alternative is to walk ~1km (~15 min). Mostly flat, minor elevation
        change
      </li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Total cost: 11140 jpy one way</li>
  <li>

    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>
    Alternative Route (Bus from Shinjuku. Have not tested)

    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>
    Minor notes:
    <ul>
      <li>
        Gala Yuzawa is close and convenient enough on the Shinkansen that you
        can easily make it a day trip. As a foreigner, if you want to go
        multiple days while returning to Tokyo at night, the Tokyo Wide Pass
        (15000 jpy) is a very good deal as it's only barely more than 2 one-way
        tickets (13380 jpy). You can also get a discounted lift ticket this way
        too.
      </li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>

<h2 id="thoughts">Thoughts</h2>
<p>
  Just some thoughts about ease of access overall. I felt getting to Geto was
  extremely convenient and I saved a lot by being able to stay in Kitakami
  instead of near the ski resort (5k-8k JPY a night instead of 10k-15k). This
  might make up the difference in cost in Shinkansen transit fare. Madarao's bus
  fare was also cheaper and more convenient so that might be a reasonable
  strategy there too, especially since Iiyama is relatively cheap too.
  Meanwhile, stuff near Nagano Station is not too much cheaper than stuff near
  the resorts especially if one considers the round trip bus cost. Lastly,
  Tazawako's uphill climb after the bus stop was truly awful.
</p>
<p>
  Gala Yuzawa is by far the best place for a day trip by Shinkansen. JR East
  literally brings you right to the resort. No transfers needed. If you manage
  to snag a JR view travel deal, it can be an insane deal. For example, on
  weekdays, the price can be as low as 8700 jpy for round trip + lift ticket. On
  weekdays, the price is closer to 15000 jpy, which is still a good deal for
  round trip + lift ticket. The downside of this convenience is that it's also
  quite crowded from Tokyo area visitors.
</p>
<p>I might update this in the future. Will likely update the dates too.</p>
