<h2 id="intro">Introduction</h2>
<p>
  I monitor my home network connectivity by sending pings at well known sites
  like <a href="google.com">google.com</a> and checking to see how many time
  out. For this purpose, I set up my own Debian box so I can have 24/7
  monitoring. I plot the number of timeouts in Grafana. The following is an
  example of pings to <a href="facebook.com"></a>
</p>

<p>
  However, this Debian box is connected via Ethernet to my router and the
  Ethernet is the default network interface for the Debian machine. Because of
  that, my ping monitoring tool can only really monitor the status of the
  Ethernet connectivity. Monitoring wifi connectivity is also a goal of mine.
</p>

<p>
  This sounds like it should be easy. Just have the program send the ping via
  the wifi network interface instead of the ethernet based one. In fact the
  default
  <code>ping</code> program can do this with flags in both Windows
  (<code>-S</code>) and Linux (<code>-I</code>). However, I'm using a Golang
  library <a href="https://github.com/go-ping/ping">go-ping</a>, which doesn't
  support <a href="https://github.com/go-ping/ping/pull/204">that</a>.
</p>

<p>
  However, even if <i>go-ping</i> supported changing interface, I'd be forced to
  run the program directly. I've been using continers with Docker and Kubernetes
  (k3s) so if possible I would prefer that. Furthermore, in k3s, changing to a
  different network interface is quite challenging because you need to switch
  from the default Flannel network overlay.

<p>
  Luckily, Docker has more easily accessible networking options. While scouring
  the web, I stumbled upon
  <a

    >this blog post</a

  That's exactly what I'm trying to do! So, I followed the instructions in the
  blog post. But, I encounterd a problem. I couldn't connect from inside the
  Docker container to the outside world using <i>macvlan</i>. It turns out
  <i>macvlan</i> does not work on wifi network interfaces. The reason appears to
  be the IEEE 802.11 standards do not allow this.
</p>

    <p>
      IEEE 802.11 doesn’t like multiple MAC addresses on a single client. It is
      likely macvlan sub-interfaces will be blocked by your wireless interface
      driver, AP or both.

  Viewing the standards themselves requires a subscription, but I found a some

  on the internet also claiming that <i>macvlan</i> won't work with wifi network
  interfaces. With this newfound knowledge, I changed my commands to use
  <i>ipvlan</i>
  instead and everything mostly just worked!
</p>

<p>
  My router/DHCP server assigned IPs from the range of
  <i>192.168.1.25</i>-<i>192.168.1.200</i> with a gateway at
  <i><i>192.168.1.1</i></i
  >. In order to avoid overlap, I picked the range <i>192.168.1.208/28</i>,
  which corresponds to the 16 ip addresses from
  <i>192.168.1.208</i>-<i>192.168.1.223</i>. I picked <i>192.168.1.222</i> to
  reserve for use by my host interface. Also note that apparently, network
  interfaces can
  <a href="https://github.com/benzea/gnome-network-displays/issues/70">only</a>
  have 15 characters in their name. Thus, my script was
</p>

<pre>
<code>docker network create -d ipvlan -o parent=my_wifi_adapter \
 --subnet 192.168.1.0/24 \
 --gateway 192.168.1.1 \
 --ip-range 192.168.1.208/28 \
 --aux-address 'host=192.168.1.222' \
 wifi_ipvlan

ip link add wifi-shim link my_wifi_adapter type ipvlan mode l2
ip addr add 192.168.1.222/32 dev wifi-shim
ip link set wifi-shim up
ip route add 192.168.1.208/28 dev wifi-shim
</code></pre>

<p>
  The other thing that wasn't mentioned in the Lars Kellogg-Stedman blog post
  was how to make the settings persistent (in Debian) through restarts. I
  initially thought I could just run my script through <i>crontab</i> (i.e.
  <code>sudo crontab -e</code> and adding a line with
  <code>@reboot path_to_my_script.sh</code>). This turned out not to be viable
  because the <i>crontab</i> would run before the interface was discoverable. I
  tried adding some minor amounts of sleep, but it required a lot more sleep
  than I wanted (20s).
</p>

<p>
  I ended up modifying my <i>/etc/network/interfaces</i> file to ensure
  persistency. I found some examples on
  <a
    href="https://unix.stackexchange.com/questions/476539/how-to-make-ip-commands-persist
"
    >various</a

  <a

    >places</a
  >
  <a
    href="https://www.cyberciti.biz/faq/ip-route-add-network-command-for-linux-explained/
"
    >online</a
  >. I ended up with the following config:
</p>

<pre><code>#ipvlan for docker connecting only to wifi
auto wifi-shim #start up automatically
iface wifi-shim inet manual
    pre-up /sbin/ip link add wifi-shim link my_wifi_adapter type ipvlan mode l2
    up /sbin/ip addr add 192.168.1.222/32 dev wifi-shim
    post-up /sbin/ip route add 192.168.1.208/28 dev wifi-shim
    post-down /sbin/ip link del wifi-shim</code>
</pre>

<p>
  With that, I set up <i>docker-compose</i> so I could ensure my ping utility
  would run on restarts. In order to make sure it would use the
  <i>wifi_ipvlan</i> network I set up earlier as well as a static ip address, I
  used settings like this:
</p>

<pre><code>services:
  ping:
    ...
    networks:
      wifi_ipvlan:
        ipv4_address: 192.168.1.208
networks:
  wifi_ipvlan:
    external: true</code></pre>
<p>
  Note that apparently with
  <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/questions/61831255/">higher versions</a> of
  <i>docker-compose</i>, this may not work, but I'm using an old version.
</p>

<p>
  With that set up, I was able get some data for pinging through my wifi
  interface. The lighter color indicates the timeouts through the wifi
  interface. The numbber of timeouts seem similar, which indicates my wifi
  itself isn't having too many issues.

<p>
  This seemed to work pretty well. I was able to connect from my Docker
  container through my wifi interface. I was also able to access my Docker
  container from other things on my local computer. Those were all things I had
  expected. However, I was able to access my Docker container even on a
  <b><i>different</i></b> computer on the network. I didn't expect that at all!
</p>

<p>
  The part that confused me the most was how could a different computer on the
  same network know to send packets addressed to <i>192.168.1.208</i> to my
  Debian machine. Before diving in this, I hadn't really dug into the details of
  how things like this work. To understand this, I had to figure out how a
  computer decides where to send packets in local networks in general. For the
  purposes of this blog, let's assume my computer is at <i>192.168.1.50</i> and
  we're trying to send a packet to <i>192.168.1.208</i>.
</p>

<p>
  First, it uses the subnet mask of my network (<i>255.255.255.0</i>), to
  determine if the target is in the local network or not. A subnet mask consists
  of 4 8-bit numbers and all the bits that are 0 are considered part of the same
  network. Since my network's subnet mask has the final 8-bit number as 0, that
  means all addresses that only differ in the final 8-bit number as considered
  part of the same network. That would mean the range
  (<i>192.168.1.0</i>-<i>192.168.1.255</i>). That is how my computer knows
  <i>192.168.1.208</i> is in the same network.
</p>

<p>
  Given an IP address, a computer has to find the MAC address associated with
  that IP address. When the result isn't cached, it does this using
  <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Address_Resolution_Protocol">ARP</a>.
  This works by having my computer broadcast to every single other device on the
  network with the destination of <i>192.168.1.255</i> asking for the MAC
  address of <i>192.168.1.208</i>. Every other device will hear this broadcast,
  but only the device that claims to be <i>192.168.1.208</i> will respond with
  its MAC address.
</p>

<p>
  Having set up <i>ipvlan</i>, when my Debian machine receives the ARP ping, it
  then knows to respond with the MAC address of its wifi interface. My computer
  then receives this and then it can send an
  <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ethernet_frame">Ethernet frame</a> with
  the appropriate source and destination MAC addresses. My router upon receiving
  the Ethernet frame would then see the destination MAC address and uses an
  internal table that matches physical port to MAC address. The router is thus
  able to forward it to my Debian machine. That's how my main machine was also
  able to access the Docker container on a remote Debian machine.
