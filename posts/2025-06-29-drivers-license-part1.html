<blurb>Converting to a Japanese Driver's License (part 1)</blurb>
<tag>japan</tag>

<h2>Getting an appointment</h2>

<p>
  Starting in August last year (2024), I decided to try to convert my Michigan
  license to a Japanese license. Unfortunately, Michigan is not one of the
  countries/states that has a bilateral treaty with Japan. Thus, I had to take
  both a knowledge test and a practical driving test on a designated driving
  course.
</p>

<p>
  While the practical driving test is the same as the one offered to Japanese
  people who opt to bypass the driving school system, the knowledge test is an
  extremely simple 10 question true/false test (think: "if there's a stop sign,
  do you have to stop?" level). The practical driving test is mostly about
  technical execution and involves having to do an S shaped curve and a 90
  degree angle turn (see
  <a
    href="https://web.archive.org/web/20250628074244/https://www.zurich.co.jp/carlife/cc-drivingschool-handle-tips/"
    >image</a
  >). These are relatively challenging, and I'm not sure most people could pass
  without practicing. Note that for the license conversion process, you don't
  have to pass a test on an actual road.
</p>

<p>
  These tests are only offered at Driver's License Centers and you must go to
  one belonging to your prefecture. Since I live in Tokyo, that means Samezu or
  Fuchu (Koto doesn't have the facilities for the practical driving test). I
  live much closer to Samezu, so I went there after preparing all the documents.
  At the time, there were no appointments so you just had to show up.
</p>

<p>
  The centers open at 8:30AM. I got there at around 8:15 on September 13, 2024,
  which was the Friday before a three-day weekend. There were already well over
  100 people in line, which I assume was related to the long weekend. I gave up
  as I didn't want to have to take the day off work. I tried again the following
  Wednesday, arriving at around 8:00AM. Even so, there were already 70-80 people
  in line. I decided to try my luck and wait in line as I had some extra time
  that day.
</p>

<p>
  I waited; the line moved seemingly quickly. Around 8:45, I got to the front
  and was told that the registration for the day had ended. You see, despite
  having a population of nearly 15 million, the Tokyo Driver's License Centers
  only accept ~40 applicants for the foreign license conversion per day, per
  location! You might say, "Hey, there aren't that many foreign residents (<a
    href="https://www.moj.go.jp/isa/publications/press/13_00047.html"
    >~700k</a
  >) in Tokyo, and many of them may have already converted. They can't literally
  ALL be trying to get a conversion right?! Maybe you just got unlucky." That's
  what I thought too.
</p>

<p>
  To minimize the odds of pure bad luck, I decided to go to the much more
  inconvenient Fuchu ceneter (travel time from my house ~1.5 hours, multiple
  transfers and a bus required). The site there was much harder to access and
  there are fewer people outside the 23 wards of Tokyo. I also decided to start
  waiting before 5am. Japanese public transit closes at night, requiring me to
  spend the night nearby at the cheapest place I could find. To my shock, when I
  arrived at the center at ~4:50am, I discovered a long line of people waiting
  there already. A number of people had been camping out in the parking lot!
  Some people had been waiting since 8pm on the previous day (instead of being
  in a hostel like me). Those people who started waiting at 8pm the previous day
  were still only around #15 in line... Apparently, there were even services
  charging 30k JPY to have someone wait in line for you... This was truly a
  dystopia.
</p>

<h3>Why are there so many people in line?</h3>

<p>
  As I waited patiently for the 3+ hours until the center opened, I talked to
  some of the people in line. I discovered the source of the oddity after
  talking to a Chinese citizen who is a fellow resident in Tokyo. Apparently,
  the Japanese government allows non-residents on tourist visas to do this
  license conversion by using their hotel as their address. According to that
  person, this began to be allowed in July 2024. This

  ></a
  >reddit post says there was minimal wait in June; the user advised people to
  show up around 8am. It seems plausible that the issue might have begun in
  July.
</p>

<p>
  The reason there are so many people in line is because of people from places
  like China/Vietnam. Because China is not a signatory to the Geneva Convention
  on Road Traffic, the Chinese driving license cannot be used to get an
  International Driving Permit (IDP). This is obviously a bummer for Chinese
  citizens if they want to drive when traveling overseas. However, if they could
  say convert to a Japanese license, they could then use their Japanese license
  to get an IDP. That's why a lot of Chinese citizens are heavily incentivized
  to try to convert their license in Japan.
</p>

<p>
  I encountered a number of Chinese citizens who claimed to have taken vacation,
  come to Japan, lined up for the conversion registration, and scheduled a test
  date. Then, they would go back to China before flying back to Japan for the
  test date a few months later. Because of these non-residents heavily
  incentivized to go through the process, the waiting line became ridiculously
  competitive! Many of these people learn only enough Japanese to understand
  instructions like "turn right at number 19." I later encountered a person who
  asked worriedly in Chinese: "I don't know any Japanese. Will I be okay?"
</p>

<p>
  Back to the day in September: I waited until the opening time and was handed a
  number. I was number 42, so it was very borderline if I could make it or not.
</p>

<p>
  I got lucky and was able to get in, barely. I think maybe up to #45 got
  through as some people didn't have the proper paperwork. I got a 1pm
  appointment as the process is slow since they checked our paperwork one at a
  time. Afterwards, I took the trivial knowledge test and did a minimal vision
  test before setting my next appointment for the practical driving test in
  January 2025.
</p>

<h2>The actual driving test</h2>

<p>
  In the interim, I didn't really do any driving at all. I had a valid
  International Driving Permit, but didn't use it to practice at all. I did,
  however, sign up for a 3-hour practice session with
  <a href="https://www.fca-jp.com/">FCA driving school</a>. The practice session
  was helpful prep for the test as I was able to practice the S curve and the 90
  degree angle turns a few times until I was able to do them consistently. They
  also gave some general tips on what to watch out for.
</p>

<p>
  The general format of the exam is that you start with 100 points and for every
  mistake, you get a penalty. Get too many penalties, and you fail the test. The
  officer who sits in the passenger seat also has access to the brakes. If they
  engage them, it's an automatic failure. One of the weirdest failure methods is
  that if you hit the curb and you continue on forwards, you fail. Instead,
  you're supposed to stop, reverse, and correct your position to not go over the
  curb. This is completely impractical in real life driving, but it's a test I
  suppose.
</p>

<p>
  Since I had an appointment, I felt okay about not having to wake up incredibly
  early to get a slot. However, I remembered that back in September even people
  with appointments were waiting in line quite early. To be safe, I started
  lining up at 7am or so. Luckily, this time I could just sleep at my house and
  wake up a bit early.
</p>

<p>
  It turned out arriving early didn't matter as they just gathered the people
  with appointments in a separate line. It also turned out that in the interim,
  they made the whole process appointment based. Good riddance to the dystopian
  scenes of waiting from 8pm on the previous day...
</p>

<p>
  Anyways, they brought the people who needed the practical test into a room
  that blocked cellular signals, gave us a quick explanation of the rules before
  checking our documents again and telling us to get ready for the test. The
  process is that 2 students go at a time. One drives while another sits in the
  back and is allowed to observe. The officer gives directions from the
  passenger seat on where to go next in the course. I had the horrible
  misfortune of going first, so I wasn't allowed to observe anyone else's
  driving.
</p>

<p>
  I was incredibly nervous as I started. Japan drives on the left side of the
  road (like the UK) and the first thing the officer told me to do was to make a
  right turn. So, I got ready to turn by going to the right turn lane. The
  lights then went to this formation:
</p>

<svg width="300" height="120" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg">
  <!-- Traffic light body -->
  <rect x="10" y="20" width="280" height="80" rx="10" ry="10" fill="#333" />

  <!-- Left arrow (lit) -->
  <circle cx="60" cy="60" r="30" fill="green" />
  <polygon points="60,45 45,60 60,75 60,65 75,65 75,55 60,55" fill="white" />

  <!-- Straight arrow (lit) -->
  <circle cx="150" cy="60" r="30" fill="green" />
  <polygon
    points="150,35 135,55 145,55 145,80 155,80 155,55 165,55"
    fill="white"
  />

  <!-- Right light (red, no arrow) -->
  <circle cx="240" cy="60" r="30" fill="red" />
</svg>

<p>
  In America, when preparing to turn left (the equivalent), you first inch into
  the intersection even before the light changes to allow you to turn. I started
  to do this. But, the officer then engaged the brakes and told me this was not
  allowed. Oops! I basically failed on the first step.
</p>

<p>
  The officer had some mercy and allowed me to continue (probably just to let me
  experience it a bit, but with the failure already marked). I did the S curve
  without issues and then the officer basically told me to head back. To head
  back, I needed to turn right again. This time, I failed to get into the proper
  lane as I hadn't noticed. The officer engaged the brakes once again. Two
  auto-failures in the same test. Oops!
</p>

<p>
  Because the paperwork check was only valid for 6 months, and the next
  available practical driving test was not until May (due to the huge number of
  applicants), I had to restart the process from the first step: paperwork check
  + knowledge test. I set it up for late February. The only good thing about
  going first was I could then go home early.
</p>

<h2>Attempt 2</h2>

<p>
  I had no problem with the February paperwork check and set up another
  practical driving test for June. I again practiced once with FCA driving
  school before the actual test. This time, it was even more helpful than the
  first time because I was used to the format and expectations. I was able to
  focus much more on perfecting the minor details. The other thing I did to
  practice was repeatedly watch this
  <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vuY-cPq_bxo">YouTube video</a>
  explaining the routes that you get asked to drive. I would practice the hand
  and head motions required for each turn in my apartment. For example, for a
  right turn, I would practice using my hand to signal, moving my head to check
  the blind spots, and then miming turning the handle with my hands. Although
  the actual courses differed from the video, it was definitely helpful to get
  into the mood.
</p>

<p>
  I determined that if I failed again, I would just go to Samezu for my next
  attempt instead of spending 1.5 hours going to Fuchu each time. In May 2025,
  two incidents in Saitama and Mie involving foreigners who had converted their
  license failing to follow the traffic laws
  <a
    href="https://web.archive.org/web/20250622155511/https://www3.nhk.or.jp/news/html/20250521/k10014812071000.html"
    >made the news</a
  >. Because of this, the whole process looks like it will require a much harder
  knowledge test similar to the Japanese one and residency requirements
  (hopefully this means the lines will no longer be miserable).
</p>

<p>
  On the day of the test, there were 22 of us doing the practical driving test.
  I got luckier this time and was assigned to go 5th. The first person, upon
  getting into the car, couldn't start it due to the hand brake being engaged
  and was yelled at by the police officer. The recent news probably made the
  police much more strict in their grading as well. The first person then
  proceeded to fail to stop at a stop sign. Oops. They drove for a bit before
  coming back to the start location, where they managed to drive the car onto
  the curb as they parked. Oops. They got a thorough berating from the officer
  and were dismissed. The second person defeated the hand brake, but also failed
  to stop at the stop sign, causing the police to engage the brakes. When they
  returned, they parked maybe 2+ feet from the curb (the goal is under 1 foot),
  probably in fear of repeating the first person's mistake. Oops. Similarly,
  they got a berating.
</p>

<p>
  The person to go 3rd originally had incorrect paperwork (said was using
  glasses, but they came to the test in contacts) and was sent back to fix the
  paperwork. Naturally, after being yelled at by the police officer. I thus got
  bumped up to go 4th. So, I sat in the back and watched the person in front of
  me drive. They didn't make any egregious mistakes, except in the S curve,
  where they hit the curb and continued on. I guess that was an autofail because
  the officer told them at the end: Hey, that's really dangerous and why you
  failed.
</p>

<p>
  It was finally my turn to go. My heart was racing. I went through the course
  and again like the first time, the first instruction was to turn right. This
  time, I waited for the signal. Learning from the first attempt! After
  completing the S curve and 90 degree angle turn with no issues, I felt pretty
  pumped. I was soon told to head back. Again, having learned from my previous
  failure, I got into the correct lane and turned right. I parked perfectly and
  the officer congratulated me and that was that! The officer did make 2
  comments during the ride though: when going to the right turn lane to make a
  turn, you're supposed to do it before an orange line apparently. Also, I was
  once too far from the left curb when making a left turn. But, it was minor
  enough that I could pass.
</p>

<p>
  After passing at around 9:30am, they told us to gather at around noon for
  another paperwork check. After the check, they took our photos and we were
  told to wait around until the licenses were ready. Out of the 22 people, only
  4 people passed (18% pass rate) so the test was fairly challenging. That said,
  of the people I observed, I think clearly the first 2 people I watched didn't
  really deserve to pass. I didn't manage to get out of the license center until
  ~3pm, having been there since 8am. A truly long day.
</p>

<h2>Concluding thoughts</h2>

<p>
  The process was much harder than expected. The process being flooded by
  non-residents did leave a sour taste in my mouth. Having to wait starting at
  4am is truly dystopic. I'm glad they switched to an appointment system and
  that the Japanese government plans to change the residency requirements. I
  don't begrudge the people who took advantage of the system, but I am a bit
  annoyed at the people who made such an obviously bad loophole with the hotel
  address being a valid address. There's no way that was on accident.
</p>

<p>
  I also really envy my friend from Washington state could do the conversion
  with no testing at all. But, I do think going through the process did help me
  refine my driving skills from the opposite side of the road. I probably won't
  be driving much in Japan, but having the option is nice when it's needed. It's
  also a nicer form of identification than a Zairyu card. I'm going to write
  more on the difficulty of the test in my next post.
