  This issue came about in the following way. When it was first released in
  January, in addition to the so called "LTE Band 3" of wavelengths that Rakuten
  Mobile operates themselves, the Rakuten Mini was able to utilize the "LTE Band
  1" that the three main phone carriers posses. The versions that Rakuten sold
  in May were changed twice and by the third version, "Band 1" was removed as a
  band it could utilize. They did not change their published technical
  specifications nor did they announce it to users.
</p>
<p>
  With regards to the change, Rakuten Mobile says this was due to device
  limitations. This is because the initial version of the Rakuten Mini did not
  have the wavelengths to support communications in North America and when they
  tried to add the bands, they had no choice but to remove Band 1.
</p>
<b> The fear of being unable to get signal</b>
<p>
  The law requires that most devices that emit radio waves such as smartphones
  must acquire the so-called "Giteki" (The Technical Standards Conformity
  Approval based on the Telecommunications Business Act and the Technical
  Standards Conformity Certification based on the Radio Law are both part of
  this) certification from The Ministry of Internal Affairs and Communications
  as a countermeasure for jamming and other interference. The Ministry finds the
  fact that the Rakuten Mini is utilizing its original Giteki despite the fact
  that it has changed its bands to be a problem.
</p>

<p>
  Through a report to The Ministry of Internal Affairs and Communications, it
  was also discovered that the initial version released in January displayed the
  certification information of after the bands were changed. This was also found
  not to fulfill the standards of the Giteki. Of the three versions of the
  Rakuten Mini, only the second version had the correct certifications.
</p>
<p>
  As a suspected violation of the rules governing the usage of radio waves, this
  is not simply a problem with the paperwork. Because Rakuten Mobile sold the
  Rakuten Mini as an unlocked smartphone, there is the risk that it caused
  damages for certain users.
</p>
<p>
  The Rakuten Mini uses an internal eSIM chip to write certification data. This
  for example allows one to use the discount carrier IIJ, which is an eSIM
  service. IIJ borrows NTT Docomo's infrastructure to conduct their business and
  Docomo uses Band 1 as the basis for their service coverage across Japan. For
  customers who want to switch to IIJ's eSIM when outside Rakuten Mobile's
  service area or customers who only bought the phone itself and want to use
  IIJ, a Rakuten Mini that is unable to use Band 1 has the risk of immensely
  decreasing the size of the coverage area for customers.
</p>
<b>Rakuten's service area is still limited</b>
<p>
  Rakuten Mobile says that the reason they changed the bands was to make it more
  convenient to use it in North America. And indeed, the latest version which
  does not have Band 1 is able to utilize the main bands of North American
  telecommunication providers. However, Band 1 is also used in North America and
  the Asia-Pacific region as an auxiliary band by telecommunication providers.
  As it currently is, if one goes to certain regions, there is the risk of the
  coverage area decreasing in size and being unable to reach certain speeds.
</p>
<p>
  Because they did not tell users when they changed their bands, Rakuten Mobile
  is allowing people who wish to to change their version to an older version.
  They also have reacquired the Giteki certification and with a software update
  now display the correct Giteki Mark on the screen.
</p>

<p>
  However, it is highly unusual to change the bands of a smartphone after it has
  been released especially without changing the published technical
  specifications. The fact that the bands the device is able to use was changed
  repeatedly makes it clear that there are internal issues inside the
  corporation.
</p>
<p>
  Rakuten Mobile reached 1 million applicants for their service at the end of
  June, which was faster than they had planned. They have a successful campaign
  in which the base monthly fee of 2980 yen is waived for the first 3 million
  applicants. On the other hand because their own coverage area is still very
  limited, issues such as connectivity problems were brought to the fore
  immediately after the service was started. In order to not decrease the pace
  at which they are gaining customers, it appears that they need to dispel the
  distrust customers have of their service.
