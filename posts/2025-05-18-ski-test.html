<h2 id="introduction">Introduction</h2>
<p>
  One of my goals in this year's ski season was to pass the SAJ Level 1 test
  (一級) in Japan.
  <a
    href="https://web.archive.org/web/20250123063129/https://snowjapanlicence.com/skitest/"
    >Here's a diagram</a
  >
  vaguely describing the system. I'll describe a little bit about what the
  general system is like as well as my travails this season.
</p>

<h2 id="explanation">Level 2 and the system explained</h2>

<p>
  You first have to pass the Level 2 exam. There are 3 events, and A passing
  grade for a specific event for Level 2 is 65, but you only need to have a
  total grade of 195 (65 average on all 3 events). I did with the following
  scores:
</p>

<table>
  <thead>
    <tr>
      <th>Date</th>
      <th>Long Turn</th>
      <th>Short Turn</th>
      <th>Stem Turn</th>
      <th>Total</th>
    </tr>
  </thead>
  <tbody>
    <tr>
      <td>2024-3-31</td>
      <td>67</td>
      <td>66</td>
      <td>64</td>
      <td>197 (passed)</td>
    </tr>
  </tbody>
</table>

<p>
  <a
    href="https://web.archive.org/web/20240423150623/http://gakuro23.com/2019/02/07/%E3%82%B9%E3%82%AD%E3%83%BC%E3%81%AE%E7%B4%9A%E5%88%A5%E3%83%86%E3%82%B9%E3%83%88%E3%82%84%E3%83%97%E3%83%A9%E3%82%A4%E3%82%BA%E3%83%86%E3%82%B9%E3%83%88%E3%81%A7%E3%81%AE%E6%A4%9C%E5%AE%9A%E3%81%AE/"
    >The idea behind the scoring</a
  >
  system is basically: +2 on the passing score for an event means you're
  equivalent of passing at the next level. -2 would mean you are quite far from
  the passing level and you would only really pass the previous level.
</p>

<h2 id="before">Thoughts before starting taking the test</h2>
<p>
  Based on my Level 2 scores, I was doing pretty well in Long turns and Short
  turns, but my Stem Turns needed work. Luckily for me, stem turns are no longer
  tested in the Level 1 exam!
</p>

<p>
  There are a total of 4 events in the Level 1 exam, and a total score of 280 is
  needed (70 average). I felt pretty confident in my long turns and if I
  improved my short turns a bit, I thought I would be at the passing level. The
  two new events are:
</p>
<ul>
  <li>
    Short Turn (Bumps): The intention here is to see you stay within the
    specified bump lane with a reasonable speed.
    <ul>
      <li>
        I've been struggling with bumps for a long time so I thought this would
        be the most challenging thing to pass.
      </li>
      <li>
        Compare to a lot of English language instruction, the main difference is
        that you must stay within the lane. If you go to the nearby lane
        (sometimes there is literally only 1 lane), you won't pass
      </li>
      <li>
        There's a movement pattern that in English is called the "green line"
        and in Japanese is called ズルドン (zurudon). From what I've read, you
        can pass with this turning pattern, but if you lose too much speed
        you'll fail.
      </li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>
    Overall Skiing (総合滑走) or Free: The intention is to see you switch turn
    size from large to small or vice versa
    <ul>
      <li>This is pretty similar to long turns so I felt pretty confident</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>
  According
  <a
    href="https://web.archive.org/web/20250216184934/https://media.snowhub.jp/howto/saj-ski-test/"
    >to this site</a
  >, it takes 30 days on snow to go from Level 2 to Level 1. According
  <a
    href="https://web.archive.org/web/20250211185718/https://skibumpslabo.com/archives/1416"
    >to this site</a
  >, the pass rate for Level 1 is around 30%.
</p>

<p>
  A month into the season, I started trying the test. All attempts were at Gala
  Yuzawa, which holds the test basically every Sunday throughout the season. The
  test is generally conducted on a relatively short course with around 20-25
  degree angle max. The courses I had tests on were: Super Swan, Joanna B,
  Joanna A, Gigi, bottom section of Entertainment (Super entertainment? ).
</p>

<p>Courses look like:</p>

  <li>
    Flats:

  </li>
</ul>

<p>
  I felt pretty good before my first attempt. I had taken some lessons a few
  weeks back and the instructor said that if he was the judge, he'd give me a +1
  score on Short Turns. I thought I'd probably do poorly on the bumps, but I
  could get a +1 in another category and pass.
</p>

<p>
  For the bumps, I attempted what the Japanese call the "bunk line", which is
  called in English the "blue line" or the "round line". I had practiced a bunch
  the previous day on the same course and managed to complete the course a
  reasonable number of times. The snow was quite icy that day (for Japan).
</p>

Unfortunately, the scores were a harsh reminder of the reality that I'm not that
good at skiing. I had crashed in the bumps event with my skis popping off so I
knew I was going to get marked down for that. Since it was the first event, I
hoped to make up for the crash with stronger performances later. Unfortunately,
my Short Turns were not up to par to even get the passing grade.

<h2 id="feb-23">Feb 23, 2025</h2>

<p>
  Since the last attempt, I practiced focusing on Short Turns, attempting to do
  a carving short turn. After failing and crashing with the bunk line, I
  resolved to do zurudon/green line for the bumps. I had read that if executed
  properly, you could pass so I focused on execution. The day was quite snowy.
</p>

    <tr>

      <td>279 (-1)</td>
    </tr>
  </tbody>
</table>

I managed to improve my Short Turns score since the previous attempt. The bumps
course had changed from the first attempt, and I wasn't prepared for the new
course, so I made a mistake and exited the course. That's what I took to be the
reason for not passing and resolved to just execute better next time.

<h2 id="mar-9">March 9, 2025</h2>

The day before, I went skiing with a colleague and recorded some video. I felt
okay at the time. However, on the day of, I was actually pretty sick. I hadn't
realized when I went to go skiing in the morning, but by midday, I was feeling
quite bad and had some diarrhea. I ended up working from home the entire
following week (I usually go to the office on most days). The snow was
relatively firm.

<table>
  <thead>
    <tr>
      <th>Date</th>
      <th>Long Turn</th>
      <th>Short Turn</th>
      <th>Short Turn (Bumps)</th>

    <tr>

      <td>69</td>

      <td>69</td>
      <td>274 (-6)</td>
    </tr>
  </tbody>
</table>

Also, it was very unfortunate I had to be the first person to go down the course
for each event. The number of people taking the test was very low (10) so they
even asked us to go down the bumps course one time for practice in order to make
the bumps deeper. When I did the events, I didn't feel particularly bad for
anything but the bumps, but my memory is not great because of the sickness. For
the bumps, I couldn't stay within the single course line so I was definitely
expecting a bad score there. My other scores reflected that I was probably
unable to use my muscles properly due to being sick.

<h2 id="mar-23">March 23, 2025</h2>

The weather had gotten pretty warm so the snow had gotten pretty soft. I had
mostly focused on getting better at bumps and especially being able to execute
properly the green line. The number of people taking the test was huge this time
(39), whereas previously it had been around 15. I aimed to get a later slot,
after having the misfortune of having to go first. I ended up literally the last
slot, but they did a rotation system so I got to go earlier in the ordering in
the later events.

<p>
  I remember for the Short Turns, losing control so I thought I was for sure
  losing points there. I remember thinking to myself that my Free event was good
  and that my Long turn event was a bit suboptimal. But the result was the
  opposite... For the bumps, I thought I had executed the zurudon pretty much
  perfectly, but was still greeted with the score of 69. I interpreted that to
  mean that I can't pass through the plain zurudon only. I needed to either
  drastically reduce the amount of time my skis were directly perpendicular to
  the slope or I needed to change my strategy entirely. I chose the latter.
</p>

<p>
  Failing this time felt pretty bad as it meant that I had made 0 progress since
  the first exam. I was fine ignoring the 3rd attempt as I was sick.
</p>

<h2 id="apr-21">April 21, 2025</h2>

<p>
  This was in late April so the snow was very slushy and soft. The day of the
  test was very cloudy and relatively cool day. As a result, the snow was
  relatively firm for spring.
</p>

<p>
  I spent nearly all the time between tests working on bumps. I took some bump
  lessons and practiced my bunk line turns. Because of the lessons, I finally
  understood what I was missing (the body must stay ON TOP of your skis when
  doing moguls, unlike for carving) when attempting the bunk line previously on
  the first attempt and why I had failed. I was able to do bunk line turns very
  consistently by this point on the expected bump course. The number of courses
  open at Gala had drastically decreased by this point, so I had a pretty good
  idea where the test would be held as well.
</p>

<p>
  Any remaining time I had spent trying to figure out exactly what was needed to
  pass in the Short Turn category by watching youtube videos explaining the
  things the judges are looking for. Apparently, the key is to control your
  speed in the first half of the turn instead of all in the second half.
</p>

      <td>280 (+0, passed!)</td>
    </tr>
  </tbody>

<p>
  I actually felt pretty confident in the bumps event in being able to execute
  and stay within the course. I also believed that should have had the correct
  strategy. I think if I had upped my speed I might have even gotten a 71. I was
  more worried about the Short Turns, where during the execution, I had felt
  mediocre. But luckily, I managed to pass. I was very happy to have finally
  achieved the goal!
</p>

<p>
  I got someone to take some video so you can judge how bad I am for yourself:

  The process was a lot harder than I expected. I had hoped that I could get a
  +1 in my long turns, but to be fair long turns weren't a major focus
  throughout the season. That'll have to be something I improve on for next
  season. Looking at the video, I definitely need to work on my transition. I
  definitely want to keep getting better at bump skiing as well.
</p>

<p>
  I definitely felt <b><i>major</i></b> improvement in my bump skiing though.
  Once spring comes to Gala Yuzawa, the right side of the main course
  (Entertainment) becomes a single very very long lane of bumps. It never gets
  that deep because it starts anew every day. However, even though the slope is
  low (maybe 15 degrees), we're talking about nearly 1km of bumps. I remember
  last year being unable to basically control myself at all on that course. I
  was simply getting hurled along for the ride with basically no control. In
  particular, I remember being able to slightly slow my speed down with my right
  foot by scraping snow, but my left foot basically had literally 0 speed
  control. This year, I was able to complete the entire run of bumps multiple
  times. I could properly use both legs to control my speed (maybe even slowing
  down too much!). The biggest challenge this year was simply that the course is
  sooo long my legs got tired and I had to stop to catch my breath/recover my
  legs.
</p>

<p>
  Even with a number of additional points on the Level 2 exam, it still took
  over a year to pass the Level 1 exam. Given that and the fact that I only
  passed the Level 1 exam with the exact passing score, I really doubt I can
  pass the next level (Technical Prize) anytime soon. It's my next goal though.
