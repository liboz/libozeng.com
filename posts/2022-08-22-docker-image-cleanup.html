<blurb>Automating Docker Image Cleanup</blurb>

<p>
  In <a href="./2022-01-13-setting-up-k8s.html">a previous post</a>, I talked
  about how I set up my own Docker registry. One issue with running your own
  Docker registry is that you need to manage the storage and do things like
  clean up old unused tags/images. There were a few gotchas to doing this
  automatically so I thought I might write a short post about it.
</p>

<p>
  First, the Docker registry by default doesn't allow deletion. One has to
  either pass in an environment variable
  <code>REGISTRY_STORAGE_DELETE_ENABLED=true</code> or use a config yaml file
  with <code>storage.delete.enabled: true</code> (see
  <a
    href="https://stackoverflow.com/questions/32563780/why-cant-i-delete-a-layer-in-my-private-docker-registryv2"
    >stackoverflow post</a
  >). I opted for using a config file like this:
</p>
<pre><code>version: 0.1
log:
  fields:
    service: registry
storage:
  cache:
    blobdescriptor: inmemory
  filesystem:
    rootdirectory: /var/lib/registry
  delete:
    enabled: true # allow deletes
  maintenance:
    readonly:
      enabled: false # enable readonly mode before garbage collections
http:
  addr: :5000
  headers:
    X-Content-Type-Options: [nosniff]
health:
  storagedriver:
    enabled: true
    interval: 10s
    threshold: 3</code></pre>

<p>I then change my docker-compose.yaml to add a volume:</p>

<pre><code>volumes:
      - ./registry-config.yaml:/etc/docker/registry/config.yml</code></pre>

<p>
  Next, I found a Docker image of a script that would delete old tags of images.
  I used
  <a href="https://hub.docker.com/r/anoxis/registry-cli">anoxis/registry-cli</a>
  (<a href="https://github.com/andrey-pohilko/registry-cli">Github</a>) with the
  following flags:
  <code
    >./registry.py -l userName:password -r registry_url --delete --num 15</code
  >. It work pretty much exactly the way I wanted!
</p>

<p>
  Lastly, I found out that the <i><b>DELETE</b></i> only soft deletes an image.
  It would only be really deleted after running a garbage collection. The
  registry image comes with a tool to run garbage collection so we just need to
  run that command. We can script that command and force a garbage collection.
  Furthermore, during the garbage collection, we should prevent writes, which
  could cause issues. That's why I also have the
  <code>storage.maintenance.readonly.enabled</code> option. I first change that
  to enabled, reboot my server, run the garbage collection, change it back to
  disabled and reboot server again.
</p>

That results this script:
<pre><code>#!/bin/bash
set -e

cd directory_with_file
echo "enabling read only mode for garbage collection"
git checkout registry-config.yaml
sed -i 's/enabled: false # enable readonly mode before garbage collections/enabled: true # enable readonly mode before garbage collections/' registry-config.yaml
docker-compose stop registry
docker-compose up -d registry
echo 'starting garbage collection'
docker-compose exec -T registry bin/registry garbage-collect --delete-untagged /etc/docker/registry/config.yml
echo 'finished garbage collection. re-enabling writes to the registry'
git checkout registry-config.yaml
docker-compose stop registry
docker-compose up -d registry</code></pre>

<p>
  Okay, this all looks pretty good. Now to do it automatically, I used my
  Kubernetes cluster's
  <a href="https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/workloads/controllers/cron-jobs/"
    >CronJob</a
  >
  feature as well as linux's default crontab feature. On my box with the
  self-hosted Docker registry, I set up the following crontab to run at 4:27AM
  every day:
</p>

<pre><code>27 4 * * * /directory_with_file/garbage_collect_docker_images.sh >> /var/log/gc_docker.log 2>&1</code></pre>

<p>
  This redirects all output of the previous script to a file at
  <code>/var/log/gc_docker.log</code>. Next, I set up a Kubernetes cronjob to
  run the <code>anoxis/registry-cli</code> image like this:
</p>

  <pre><code>---
apiVersion: batch/v1

  name: delete-old-images-docker-registry
  namespace: cron

  schedule: "0 4 * * *" # every day at 4am
  jobTemplate:
    spec:
      template:
        spec:
          containers:
            - name: delete-old-images-docker-registry
              image: anoxis/registry-cli
              command:
                [
                  "./registry.py",
                  "-l",
                  "userName:password",
                  "-r",
                  "registry_url",
                  "--delete",
                  "--num",
                  "15",
                ]
              resources:
                requests:
                  cpu: 10m
                  memory: 50Mi
                limits:
                  cpu: 300m
                  memory: 300Mi
          restartPolicy: OnFailure
      backoffLimit: 3</code></pre>
</details>

<p>
  Great! Now the last thing I want is to be able to pick up the logs from the
  crontab I set up earlier so that I can see them in Kubernetes for easier
  monitoring. I have a k3s agent on that server so I can also set up a CronJob
  to simply read the logs, clear them, and exit. Then my promtail agent can read
  the logs from the pod and store them for easier access. That config looks like
  thus:

                type: File
      backoffLimit: 3</code></pre>
</details>

<p>
  Thanks to this setup, I went from 12GB of storage used for the Docker registry
  to 3GB and I can feel confident that from now on, I'll be able to maintain a
  low storage usage.
</p>

<p>
  One other minor note: The <i><b>DELETE</b></i> API provided by the registry
  only allows for the deletion of manifest, not tags. What this means for us
  that is even if we use the API to delete all manifests associated with a tag,
  that tag will still show up in the <i>catalog</i> API for gets. In order to
  delete it from the catalog, you have to delete it manually from the disk like
  thus:
</p>

<code>rm -rf data/docker/registry/v2/repositories/repository_name</code>

<p>
  Only then will the repository be properly cleaned up from the
  <i>catalog</i> API. Doing this without manual deletion from disk be possible
  in the SoonTM
