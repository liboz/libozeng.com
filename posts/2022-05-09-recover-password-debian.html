<blurb>Resetting debian account password</blurb>
<tag>linux</tag>

<p>
  I needed to run a <code>sudo</code> command recently on my Debian Linux box.
  Unfortunately, I had forgotten the password on the main account since I was
  using an ssh key for all my needs. I also locked root and couldn't access via
  ssh.
</p>

<p>
  Since I have physical access, I thought this would pretty easy. Everyone
  always says that with physical access, it's trivial to get root access.
</p>

<p>
  At first, I tried simply booting into recovery mode. Sadly, I was greeted with
  a message that my root account was locked and the defaults didn't work.
</p>

<p>
  So, I followed the instructions
  <a
    href="https://linuxways.net/debian/how-to-reset-a-forgotten-root-password-in-debian-10-11/"
    >here</a
  >. For my own reference, it basically consisted of modifying the advanced boot
  options on boot. The specific modification was to change the line that looks
  like <code>linux /vmlinux... root=... other stuff</code> to something like
  <code>linux /vmlinux... root=... init=/bin/bash</code> and then starting the
  boot process. In theory after that occurs, I can simply remount using
  <code>mount -o remount,rw /</code> followed by resetting the password via
  <code>passwd myUser</code>.
</p>

<p>
  Unfortunately for me, that didn't work either. The error message that greeted
  me was:
</p>

<pre><code
    >bash: cannot set terminal process group (-1): Inappropriate ioctl for device</code
  ></pre>

<p>
  I found someone who encountered a similar problem on
  <a href="https://askubuntu.com/questions/1176063/change-the-root-password"
    >askubuntu</a
  >, but sadly there was no solution. Like the person on askubuntu, I had that
  message and pressing keys on the keyboard had no response. I had to physically
  press the reboot button to get back to GRUB.
</p>

<p>
  However, I noticed one thing. The logging indicated that my USB keyboard was
  being detected. But the timestamp was after the <code>ioctl</code> related
  message. Since I had no better ideas, I swapped the keyboard's USB port to a
  different one. Miraculously, that USB port was loaded before the
  <code>ioctl</code> error. Because of that, even though I still got the
  <code>ioctl</code> error message, pressing keys on my keyboard worked! With
  that, I was able to do the <code>mount</code>/<code>passwd</code> commands and
  reset my password. Interesting that the specific port chosen actually
  mattered!
