<blurb>How an Aomori Train Station 14x'd its passenger count</blurb>

  Typically, the number of passengers at local stations in non-metropolitan
  areas of Japan has been decreasing over the years. As an example,
  Aizu-Wakamatsu Station (会津若松駅) in Fukushima Prefecture went from
  <a href="https://www.jreast.co.jp/passenger/2000_02.html"
    >3595 daily boardings in 1999</a
  >
  to
  <a href="https://www.jreast.co.jp/passenger/2019_04.html"
    >2434 daily boardings in 2019</a
  >. Some major reasons for this include the general aging of the country and
  the depopulation of Japan's smaller cities as young people move to the major
  metro areas.
</p>
<p>
  The decreasing user base combined with the ongoing maintenance costs has led
  many local stations to be closed over the years. This is most visible in
  Hokkaido where the population density was never high to begin with and the
  maintenance costs are higher due to the snow/cold winters. It's not uncommon
  to read about Hokkaido stations with <1 daily boardings. 恩根内駅, 初野駅,
  愛山駅, 滝ノ上駅, and 中ノ沢駅, all in Hokkaido, were closed in the most

  in 2024. However, this problem of decreasing population density is something
  that affects the entire country and many local train lines/stations are
  heavily in the red and thus at risk of closure. The problem is only generally
  expected to get worse over time.
</p>
<p>
  However, I recently learned that Nonai Station (野内駅) in Aomori City managed
  to buck this trend. In 2004, it had 30 daily boardings.

<p>But in 2016, it had 445 daily boardings</p>

<p>
  Consdering the context of slow but steady decline of local lines, this is
  really a miraculous 14x increase in the passenger base. The things that
  allowed Nonai Station to buck the trend was two-fold:
</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    The original position of the station was inconveniently far and it was moved
    closer to the city center in 2011 (generally increasing population density
    near the station)
  </li>
  <li>
    The impetus for the move was that Aomori Technical High School
    (青森工業高等学校) moved some 9km. The train station was moved to its
    current position to make it easy for these students to commute to school.
  </li>

      内外からの主な通学手段となる鉄道利用の増加が見込まれることから、同校近傍に新駅を設置
      し、利便性の向上・利用者の増加を図ります。(As for the Nonai Area, in
      tandem with the relocation of Aomori Technical High School away from
      Aomori Station, in financial year Heisei 23 [2011], a new station was set
      up to be near the campus. This was done in expectation that the main
      commuting pattern to school would be via trains. The aim is to increase
      the convenience and the number of passengers.)
      <p>
        <a
          href="https://www.city.aomori.aomori.jp/toshi-seisaku/shiseijouhou/matidukuri/koutsu/documents/honpen.pdf"

</ul>

  As a result, the station gained a large number of daily school commuters from
  the nearby high school. The number of students attending Aomori Technical High
  School was
  <a
    href="https://www.pref.aomori.lg.jp/soshiki/kyoiku/e-kaikaku/files/seitozyoukyou.pdf"
    >569</a
  >
  in 2023-2024, so a large number of them are clearly using the train to get to
  and from school. The cost of moving the station will likey pay for itself with
  the increase in passengers (some quick estimates: 500mil JPY to move the
  station, 5000 yen per month for the student commuter pass * 500 students per
  month -> 30 mil JPY per year. Pays for itself in 16 years) and it undeniably
  makes life easier for all the students who now use it to commute to school.
</p>
<p>
  This kind of coordinated movement was likely only possible because the
  station's ownership changed from JR East (based on Tokyo) to Aomori Prefecture
  as part of the opening of the Shinkansen to Aomori City (when opening
  Shinkansen lines, JR group companies can choose to divest non-profitable local
  lines that run in parallel). Since the railroad company, Aoimori Railway Line,
  is now owned by the Prefecture, it was probably much easier to align the
  interests of the railroad company and the local city/citizens. Aoimori Railway
  Line replicated its success by opening a branch new station, Tsutsui Station
  (筒井駅), near another high school. There are also hundreds of daily users in
  that station.
</p>
<p>
  This whole strategy is honestly quite impressive and it feels like a great use
  of the existing railroad resources. The lines themselves are not changed and
  it only involves building new stations. It'll be really interesting to see if
  other places will attempt and succeed at replicating this sort of strategy. It
  could make life more convenient for local residents and preserve local lines.
