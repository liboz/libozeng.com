<blurb>Stumbling blocks on Moving to Japan</blurb>
<tag>japan</tag>

<p>
  I've recently moved to Japan. This post is ust a vague collection of issues
  and weird things I've encountered as I'm getting settled in Japan. There might
  be a followup in the future.

  <li>
    Bank account opening
    <ul>
      <li>
        This process took 3 days of going to a bank and trying to open an
        account. I didn't have the proper documents the first two times so I had
        to ask my company for the documents and wait.
      </li>
      <li>
        Major points of nuisance:
        <ul>
          <li>
            Either 6 months since arriving in Japan or proof of employment is
            required to open a bank account
            <ul>
              <li>
                For proof of employment, the following is required
                <ul>
                  <li>
                    Employee full name (must match the value on the 在留 card)
                  </li>
                  <li>Company name</li>
                  <li>
                    <b>Company seal (印鑑)</b>
                    <ul>
                      <li>
                        My company provided the form without the official seal
                        as a copy with the official seal would take some time.
                        It didn't pass the bank's scrutiny so we had to get the
                        copy with the seal made
                      </li>
                    </ul>
                  </li>
                  <li>Employee start date</li>
                  <li>Company phone number</li>
                </ul>
              </li>
            </ul>
          </li>
          <li>
            A seal (印鑑)
            <ul>
              <li>
                For banks, it seems they don't care too much what is written on
                the inkan. I created an inkan with my Chinese name (not on any
                official documents such as passport/在留 card) as well as one
                with my English name in cursive. Upon asking the bank employee,
                they said to use the version with my Chinese name.
                <ul>
                  <li>
                    Side Note: For fun, I asked if a smiley face on one's inkan
                    was okay. They said it'd be okay as part of the seal.
                    However, if it was the only thing on the seal, it would be
                    probably not okay
                  </li>
                </ul>
              </li>
              <li>
                I made some at Don Quixote's automatic inkan making machines for
                ~2000 jpy. This appeared to be the fastest way to make an inkan.
                It took about 20 minutes per inkan.

    Officially Registered Seal (実印)
    <ul>
      I had to get a one of these in order to sign an apartment rental contract.
      Unfortunately, it seems like the rules for what is allowed/required
      differs by city/ward you live in. While Shibuya's
      <a
        href="https://web.archive.org/web/20230530170849/https://www.city.shibuya.tokyo.jp/kurashi/inkan/inkan-tetsuzuki/shinsei.html"
        >website</a
      >
      has a chart explaining the basics of what is allowed/not on the seal
      (alphabet letters or kana are okay), my ward (Shinagawa) did not have that
      information. So, I went to the ward office and asked. The rules are
      apparently like this:
      <ul>
        <li>Either alphabet or kana is okay</li>
        <li>
          Any part of your name is okay, but it must be an entire block (i.e.
          only "Libo" or only "Zeng" is okay, but "L Zeng" or "L Z" are not)
          <ul>
            <li>
              I believe you can do like "ジョン Smith" (John in kana) with mixed
              kana/alphabet parts, but I'm not 100% my memory is accurate here
            </li>
          </ul>
        </li>
        <li>Any font is okay as long as the ward worker can read it</li>
      </ul>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>
    Signing two copies of a contact (one for each party) is common
    <ul>
      <li>
        I had to do this when signing my apartment contract. My hand started to
        hurt after writing my name + kana pronunciation + date + current address
        for the 10th time or so. I really hope this can be improved by the next
        time I sign a contract...
      </li>
    </ul>

    Vietnamese food is apparently very smelly (not really sure about the
    truthyness of this)
    <ul>
      <li>
        I was talking to an apartment rental agent trying to get a new place,
        and we had the following conversation:
        <ul>
          <li>
            Agent: By the way, what country are you from? (I had already
            indicated I was non-Japanese)
          </li>
          <li>Me: America, but why does it matter?</li>
          <li>
            Agent: To be frank, some landlords don't rent to Vietnamese because
            they make smelly food
          </li>
        </ul>
      </li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>
    Names must match exactly
    <ul>
      <li>
        When trying to link my JR East points account (JRE point) and my JR
        booking site account (ekinet), my name didn't match and the linking
        website wouldn't work. This was due to some interesting instructions
        when signing up.
        <ul>
          <li>
            The JRE point site signup required name in Kanji and then name in
            Kana/Romaji.
            <img src="assets/jre-point-signup.png" />
            <p>
              Naturally, the Kanji line did not accept any alphabetical
              characters such as my name. So I input the kana pronunciation of
              my name. And in the field that said Romaji, I put in my English
              name.
            </p>
          </li>
          <li>
            Ekinet had a more "standard" format of just requiring name + kana
            prounciation. So, I put in my English name + kana pronunciation.
          </li>
          <li>
            However, these didn't match up properly because the JRE point site
            Kanji line was matched to my English name in Ekinet and the English
            name in the JRE point site was matched to the Kana pronunciation in
            Ekinet. The JRE point site not allowing Romaji for the main name led
            me to this problem.
          </li>
          <li>
            Luckily, Ekinet just let you change your name on the website (the
            wait time for the call center is probably an hour or something...)
            so I could easily convert to all kana in ekinet. I had to call the
            JRE point call center to get them to change my name to all kana. For
            someone who has minimal Japanese skills, requiring a phone call is
            quite high of a barrier. However, I suppose the entire signup
            process is all in Japanese so a person with minimal Japanese skills
            might not sign up in the first place.

        (Update 2023-05-06) Middle Name
        <ul>
          <li>
            I got a phone call from the place I'm renting from. They claimed I
            hadn't paid my rent for 2 months (March/April). I was very surprised
            as I had definitely paid so I went to double check. After some
            investigation and some phone calls later, the reason was found to be
            that the names didn't match exactly. I had used my full name (with
            middle name) in my rent application, but the rent payment was only
            with my first + last name. Whatever automated system they used
            couldn't figure it out and caused them to think I hadn't paid rent.
          </li>

    </ul>

  <li>
    Emergency Contact must have a Japanese number
    <ul>
      <li>
        I don't have family in Japan so I had to use someone I know as an
        emergency contact. But in an event of an emergency, all they would do is
        call my family in America. Forcing a middleman is rather pointless. The
        same issue might honestly be a thing in America, but I suppose this is
        only a thing you notice when you are alone by yourself in a foreign
        country.

    Many websites don't accept local debit cards (and many also don't accept
    foreign credit cards)
    <ul>
      <li>
        I had known that foreign credit cards are not useable in certain cases
        (like
        <a
          href="https://web.archive.org/web/20240319033634/https://atadistance.net/2023/07/15/foreign-visa-cards-blocked-for-japanese-mobile-and-online-payments/"
          >JR related things</a
        >
        don't let you use foreign visas except at the ticket office or vending
        machines), but it was surprising to me that some services don't allow
        payment by local debit cards. One example is Tokyo Gas, which did allow
        using a foreign credit card, but not a local debit card for some odd
        reason. I don't remember this being an issue in America ever.
