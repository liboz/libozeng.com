<blurb>Middle Names Struggles part 2</blurb>
<tag>japan</tag>

<p>
  As I described in a
  <a href="2024-04-29-japan-move.html">previous post</a>, having a middle name
  is a bit of a struggle in Japan. This time, when I signed up for a credit
  card, the credit card company somehow messed up my name really badly. This was
  relevant because in order to sign up for their online portal, you have to
  input your name exactly as the credit card company has it recorded.
</p>
<p>The way I typically fill out my name is like:</p>
<ul>
  <li>First Name: Libo my_middle_name</li>
  <li>Last Name: Zeng</li>
</ul>
<p>
  I tried a bunch of combinations of this but none of them worked. After a
  number of hours of this, I gave up and called their help center. They
  confirmed my details etc and eventually told me they had used the following
  combination
</p>
<ul>
  <li>First Name: my_middle_name</li>
  <li>Last Name: ZengLibo (no spaces naturally)</li>
</ul>
<p>
  This was truly an unexpected combination that I'd never input. I have no idea
  how this happened. Just another case of where having a middle name sucks in
  Japan.
