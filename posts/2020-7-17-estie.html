  estimates the rental cost of office buildings in various locations via their
  unique AI algorithms based on publicly available real estate data. Unlike for

  over 70,000 buildings and 20,000 unoccupied units around Japan along with the
  tenancy info in the 23 wards of Tokyo. As part of an improvement project to go

  estate management companies, and intermediaries is being refined, and the

  este offers two services: estie for corporations that want to rent an office
  building and estie pro for building owners and management companies. estie is
  a service that lets one search for offices that match certain criterion and
  are located in a prefecture, city, village, or closest station of one's
  choosing. Asking for a viewing of the building from the results is also
  possible.

  For building owners and management companies, the advantage of estie pro is
  that it allows them to determine their rent while being able to see the
  changes in rent of nearby office buildings. Because of this, it makes it
  possible for them to determine a proper rental price and thus reduce the
  vacancy time.
