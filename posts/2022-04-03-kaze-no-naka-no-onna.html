<blurb>風の中の女 review</blurb>
<tag>日本語</tag>

<p>
  Recently, I finished reading 風の中の女 by
  <ruby>北方謙三<rt>きたかた けんぞう</rt></ruby>
</p>

<p>
  I picked it up on a whim a number of years ago in a random Japanese bookstore
  (probably somewhere in Hokkaido, but I forget exactly). I had never heard of
  the author nor did I know anything about the book. There aren't many reviews
  in any language, so I thought I'd write up something. Spoilers will be marked,
  but should generally be minor.
</p>

<p>
  Unfortunately for me, the book is part of a two part series. I have not read
  the first book so many things were confusing for me. This series apparently
  the only one that the author has written featuring a female protagonist. The
  author writes mostly hardboiled mystery novels.
</p>

<p>
  The story follows independent interior designer Miyu. It begins by describing
  her everyday life with her assistant <ruby>典子<rt>のりこ</rt></ruby
  >. Things start to pick up a bit when characters from the prequel start
  showing up again.
</p>

<p>
  One thing that quite annoyed me about the writing was that the author would go
  between plot points really quickly and it was hard to follow them all. For
  example, in the middle of the book there was a scene where Miyu goes to lie
  down on her bed but then discovers
  <span class="spoilers">a cat's neck</span> in it. That is quickly followed by
  Miyu getting into some trouble. I felt like I barely had enough time to
  process the discovering of the object, but the author had already moved on.
  There were a number of other times this happened. Something plot relevant
  would occur and the story immediately talks about it as a fait accompli. I had
  to deduce backwards from the implications that a plot relevant point had
  occurred instead of having it clearly communicated to me. That made it hard
  for me to follow along. Perhaps other people might have an easier time.
</p>
<p>
  Additionally, the bored. It was hard for me to visualize all the things that
  were happening. book has a lot of action scenes, including a long
  <span class="spoilers">car chase</span>. Reading some Japanese reviews, lots
  of people found them exciting. However, after the first 10 pages or so of that
  long scene, I got fairly It just felt like a word salad to me. It could be
  just my Japanese language skill was weak.
</p>

<p>
  The protagonist was not particularly interesting. There was an afterward
  written by a reviewer that I agree with. That reviewer claims that author was
  not particularly interested in writing the human characters. Instead the
  author wrote lovingly about the various sports cars and fashionable suits and
  things like that. It definitely shows in the amount of effort to talk about
  those aspects.
</p>

<p>
  Lastly, the villains of the novel was completely and utterly lame. Bigger
  spoiler:
  <span class="spoilers"
    >They barely show up in the pages itself and there's no real understanding
    why they were so interested in ruining Miyu's life. I felt the same way
    towards them that Miyu does at the end: complete apathy.</span

</p>

<p>
  I've mostly only talked about things that I felt unenjoyable about the book,
  so now maybe I should mention some more enjoyable and interesting aspects.
  This was the first novel I've read in Japanese where I felt like I didn't need
  to use the dictionary much at all. That made reading it much faster and may
  have been a result of the genre. Another interesting aspect was that the
  choice of 漢字 was often very unusual and old. For example, 較べる for
  比べる、蒲団 for 布団、毀れる for 壊れる. The book was written in the late
  80s, so I wonder why the 漢字 forms were so odd.
</p>

<p>
  Overall, I can't really say that I would reccommend the book. But for me
  personally, I did feel a sense of progression in my language studies.
