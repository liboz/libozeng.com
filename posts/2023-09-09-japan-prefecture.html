<h3 id="introduction">Introduction</h3>
<p>
  A long time ago, I remember challenging a friend to name the capital of all
  the prefectures of Japan, which turned out to be easier than I had thought.
  I'd ask the prefecture and they'd have to respond with the capital. Although
  my friend failed the challenge, what I didn't realize was that the majority of
  Japanese prefectures have the same name as their prefectural capitals. This is
  very much unlike American states.
</p>

<p>
  More recently, I asked myself: What's the story behind the prefectural capital
  usually being same as the prefecture name? And what were the reasons a city
  would be picked as a capital? What is the story behind the founding of the
  prefectures?
</p>
<p>
  For the second question, I assumed the main reasons would be something like
  the following:
</p>
<ol>
  <li>Largest city in the prefecture at the time of founding</li>
  <li>Central location in the prefecture - For ease of transportation</li>
  <li>Historical "importance"</li>
</ol>

<p>
  I spent the last few months searching the web for an answer to those three
  questions, mostly using Japanese language sources. I didn't read any books
  cover to cover, though that might have helped. This post is a summary of the
  information I dug up. I tried my best to use "official" sources, but sometimes
  the reasons are mostly speculation. I will use the Western calendar as the
  system is just way easier to understand. The ordering of the prefectures will
  be by the Japanese governmental order which is approximately North to South.
  The date I chose is when the prefecture got most of its modern form. I will
  generally ignore offshore islands. Small changes could have occurred after the
  given date.
</p>
<p>
  The population source I generally use is the first
  <ruby>共武政表<rt>きょうぶせいひょう</rt></ruby> survey from 1875 (vol

  the army and is available in digitized form. Wikipedia also has a nice

  of other data sources from that era.
</p>

<p>
  But first, some general background information about the creation of Japanese
  prefectures. This is probably not needed if you're well versed in Japanese
  history, though it would have helped me before starting this research.
</p>

<h4 id="meiji_background">Background</h4>
<p>
  The current prefectures of Japan came about around the time of the
  <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Meiji_Restoration">Meiji Restoration</a
  >. Many of them correspond almost entirely to one or more old
  <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Provinces_of_Japan">
    <ruby>令制国<rt>りょうせいこく</rt></ruby></a
  >
  (Provinces) set up in the Nara era (710-794), which remained unchained
  throughout until the Meiji Restoration (1868). However, throughout the
  Tokugawa Shogunate, the actual subdivisions in use was the 藩 (han/domain).
  Domains were controlled by a feudal overlords or 大名 (daimyo). All daimyos
  were nominally under the suzerainty of the Tokugawa Shogun, who also had a
  number of places under direct control such as Tokyo (Edo) and Osaka. Domains
  were replaced with prefectures with the
  <ruby>廃藩置県<rt>はいはんちけん</rt></ruby> (abolish domains and establish
  prefectures) movement in 1871.
</p>

<p>
  The military capabilities of each of these daimyos was approximated via
  <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kokudaka">石高</a> (kokudaka). One 石高
  was supposed to be enough to feed one person for one year and non-rice items
  were converted into rice units for the purposes of the calcuation. The largest
  assessed value for one of the daimyos was <ruby>加賀藩<rt>かがはん</rt></ruby
  >, based in modern day Kanazawa, at over 1 million. Furthemore, because the
  assessed values were not updated frequently, many domains had effective 石高
  that was much higher than the nominal amount (<ruby
    >長州<rt>ちょうしゅう</rt></ruby
  >, modern day 山口, had an assessed
  <a href="https://ja.wikipedia.org/wiki/%E7%9F%B3%E9%AB%98"
    >369k vs 978k effective</a
  >)
</p>

<p>
  Lastly, a small bit about the Meiji restoration itself. The restoration is
  often said to be brought about by the 4 southwestern provinces of 薩長土肥
  (<ruby><b>薩</b>摩<rt>さつま</rt></ruby> modern day Kagoshima,
  <ruby><b>長</b>州<rt>ちょうしゅう</rt></ruby> modern day 山口,
  <ruby><b>土</b>佐<rt>とさ</rt></ruby> modern day Kouchi, and
  <ruby><b>肥</b>前<rt>ひぜん</rt></ruby> modern day Saga). Of these 4, 薩長土
  were the original anti-shogun instigators and 肥前 was added later. The
  anti-shogun forces fought in civil war called the
  <ruby>戊辰戦争<rt>ぼしんせんそう</rt></ruby> (Boshin war). The most opposition
  came from Northern Japan, who formed the so called Northern Alliance. As the
  eventual victors in the power struggle, the southwestern provinces also took
  over the majority of the governmental positions after the Restoration.
</p>
<p>
  One thing they did with that governmental power was to create the prefectures
  of Japan. This is the so called
  <a
    href="https://ja.wikipedia.org/wiki/%E8%B3%9E%E7%BD%B0%E7%9A%84%E7%9C%8C%E5%90%8D%E8%AA%AC"
    ><ruby>賞罰的県名説<rt>しょうばつてきけんめいせつ</rt></ruby></a
  >
  (Theory that Prefectural Names are a Reward/Punishment). There are a few
  variations of the theory, but they effectively claim that the names of the
  prefectures were picked as a reward/punishment for the events of the
  Restoration/Boshin War. In particular, it splits the domains/prefectures into
  <ruby>忠勤藩<rt>ちゅうきんはん</rt></ruby> (loyal domains),
  <ruby>曖昧藩<rt>あいまいはん</rt></ruby
  >/<ruby>日和見藩<rt>ひよりみはん</rt></ruby> (unclear domains/opportunistic
  domains), and <ruby>朝敵藩<rt>ちょうてきはん</rt></ruby> (domains that were
  the enemies of the court aka enemies of the Meiji Revolution). One claim of
  this theory is that non-loyal domains were supposedly not allowed to use their
  prefectural capital city name as the prefectural name. Furthermore, the
  capitals of many non-loyal domains were not allowed to be prefectural
  capitals. This theory has a number of issues and is certainly an
  oversimplification. For example, many of prefectural names were returned to
  the prefectural capital names like 富山 and there were many cases were the
  capitals of non-loyal domains were allowed to be prefectural capitals for many
  years like 若松県, which lasted 7 years. Despite these flaws, the theory has
  some merit so we'll mention this theory in some discussions, especially when
  the information is limited.

    北海道 was formed from the merger of <ruby>根室県<rt>ねむろけん</rt></ruby

    Commission.

    The Hokkaido Development Commission (開拓使庁) was established in 1869 in
    Tokyo. The buildings moved to 函館 in 1870 and then to 札幌 in

    then, the reason for the move from Hakodate to Sapporo may have been that
    Hakodate was too far to the south of the

  </p>

  Sapporo was chosen as the spot in central Hokkaido for development for reasons
  such as the following:

      the government offices are placed here in Sapporo, Ishikari will soon be
      as prosperous as Osaka and Tsuishikari will be equal to Fushimi.)

    reason was that Hirosaki was not centrally located after the merger of so

    inconvenient to the people of Aizu, to remove the remnants of the anti-Meiji
    domains, Kooriyama was not big and had never historically been a capital,
    and Fukushima was a market town [note: as opposed to a samurai town] and

    The ideal choice of a prefectural capital would be in central Fukushima like

    plain. With the development of the Asaka Canal (<ruby

    at Utsunomiya University, because Utsunomiya Prefecture only had the

      >main argument</a

    was that Tochigi was too far south in the prefecture now that the Kouzuke

    The Touhoku Main Line railroad also would go through Utsunomiya but not
    Tochigi. The Utsunomiya faction had dedicated supporters in 5 of Tochigi
    Prefecture's 9 districts while Tochigi City only had 2 districts as
    supporters. The biggest argument against moving was the cost of moving and
    the sunk cost of having newly built prefectural buildings in Tochigi.
    However, one major counterpoint and factor in the success of the movement
    was that Utsunomiya citizens were willing to pay for the move themselves:

    The zeal of the Utsunomiya citizens for the move was tangible in the

    for the move was written in the Tokyo Nichi Nichi Shimbun (東京日日新聞,

    that Yokohama was part of Kanagawa. The Shogunate spent lots of effort to
    build Yokohama and also at the same time, they banned entertainment like
    prostitutes in Kanagawa to entice foreigners to go to Yokohama. This made
    Yokohama flourish and Kanagawa station slowly decline. Kanagawa station is

    Treaty foreigners were allowed to go (外国人遊歩規定 included up to 六郷川 —

    voluntarily in 1893 to form the current shape of Kanagawa. For more

    government didn't get any support from the Meiji government and overextended
    itself financially. Only a few months after the opening of the new school,

    The fact that it had fought so fiercely against the Meiji government in the

    splitting of the prefecture. The alignment of both citizen and central

    Ishikawa was first formed as Kanazawa Domain in 1869. It then became
    Kanazawa Prefecture in 1871. In 1872, the capital temporarily moved to
    <ruby>美川<rt>みかわ</rt></ruby> and got the name Ishikawa. In 1876, it
    absorbed modern Toyama and northern Fukui Prefectures. In 1881, Fukui became

    Although Kaga Domain controlled Kaga, Noto, and part of Etchuu Provinces,

    were:
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li>
      With only Kaga province under control, Kanazawa was too far to the north.
      Mikawa was more central.
    </li>
    <li>
      Because of the abolishment of hereditary allowances (<ruby
        >家禄<rt>かろく</rt></ruby
      >) to samurais, work for them would result in them leaving Kanazawa and
      the inevitable decline of Kanazawa.
    </li>
    <li>
      Poor residents of Kanazwa petitioning the government would be a problem
    </li>
  </ul>
  <p>
    The petition was accepted by the central government, but the name was
    changed to Ishikawa. One possible reason for the name change is that Kaga
    Domain was a unclear domain (曖昧藩) and the central government found it a
    convenient opportunity to change the name without upsetting the samurai of
    Kanazawa too much. Apparently, there were

    that after the announcement of the move, there were plans to attack the
    governor. However, Kanazawa Prefecture had already existed so this reasoning
    is somewhat suspect. Another possible reason for the name change is that
    inside the central government there was a rivalry between people from
    Satsuma and Choushuu. Since the governor was from Satsuma and a Choushuu
    person was in control of the Ministry of Finance, it's

      Ishikawa prefecture now contained Noto Province and Kanazawa was more
      central when considering both provinces. The original assumption of only
      containing Kaga Province was no longer true
    </li>
    <li>A school was being set up in Kanazawa</li>
    <li>
      A court of law was being set up in Kanazawa and it'd be inconvenient to

  <summary>
    Fukui Prefecture was first formed from the old Fukui Domain. After
    consolidation with a number of nearby prefectures in 1871, the modern day
    area was divided amongst 福井県 and <ruby>敦賀県<rt>つるがけん</rt></ruby
    >. Fukui was renamed to <ruby>足羽県<rt>あすわけん</rt></ruby> in 1872. In
    1873, Asuwa Prefecture was merged into Tsuruga Prefecture. In 1876, the
    northern part of the prefecture was merged into Ishikawa and the southern
    part merged into Shiga prefecture. In 1881, both parts were split off again
    from Ishikawa and Shiga and formed the modern day Fukui Prefecture.

    for merging Toyama and Fukui into Ishikawa were to reduce the expenditures
    by prefectures by consolidating and strengthen central control by reducing
    the reliance on former samurai in old domains. However, Ishikawa prefecture
    was already a very difficult prefecture to govern with numerous samurai.
    Merging in Toyama and Fukui only made it more challenging.

    Northern Fukui claimed they were very different from the people of Noto,

    Supposedly, the samurai thought that if the government offices at Matsumoto
    were unusable Ueda would become the prefectural capital as logically a
    central location like Matsumoto or Ueda would make sense. Thus, they saw it
    as beneficial to Ueda to commit arson. 3 suspects were eventually detained,

    offices were unusable, Nagano's offices were considered good enough even if
    it was too far to the north.

    Another potential consideration for Nagano was that 長野 was a temple town

    Depending on the region, the reactions differed. For example, the Oki

    Houki Province shared many customs with

    than Tottori. However, the people of Inaba were very upset. Tottori Domain
    had been a much larger domain (320k vs 180k 石高) in previous times.
    Furthermore, Tottori was an ardent supporter of the Meiji Restoration

    Domain), the death of the top domain officials, and the taking of the domain

    to suicide. However, thanks to the intervention of Tottori Domain lord, who
    was a strong Meiji supporter, Matsue didn't have to do any of the above.
    This incident was one reason why Tottori was upset about being merged into

    Hiroshima's exploits were more publicized, it would make Saga look bad.
    Instead of 薩長土肥, it might have been 薩長土芸. Lastly, Hiroshima only had

    in Ehime). According to the Kagawa Prefectural History (<a

      >愛媛県史</a
    >), some of the problems of the merger for the people of Kagawa were:
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li>
      Unfairness in Education: In 1881, Iyo Province (Ehime) sent 80 people to
      prefectural school for educating teachers located in Matsuyama, Ehime
      while Sanuki Province (Kagawa) sent only 22. A main reason for the low
      number was distance and other inconveniences. This was supposedly the
      biggest reason as lack of education would eventually result in economic
      decline.
    </li>
    <li>
      Distance: Getting to Matsuyama, Ehime would take 3+ days typically by
      road. By sea, many days would be wasted due to strong waves.
    </li>
    <li>
      Differences in culture causing differences in priority: For Kagawa, sugar
      production was a major industry. So, Kagawa wanted to use some money to
      fund people to study the latest methods overseas. However, in Ehime where
      the sugar industry is not important, the proposal was rejected.
    </li>
    <li>
      Unfair distribution of taxes: Every year some

        >40k Yen</a
      >
      of tax revenue from Kagawa would go only to benefit Ehime.
    </li>
  </ul>
  <p>
    There were doubts from the Ministry of Home Affairs that Kagawa would be
    able to support itself as Kagawa is small in both size and population
    (Kagawa is currently the smallest prefecture by land area). Because of that,
    there was discussion whether or not to merge with Tokushima again. Kagawa
    said that if the choice was between Tokushima and Ehime, they preferred
    Ehime. However, Kagawa also would show evidence they were actually above
    average in population and rice paddy count in both Shikoku and all of Japan.
    Eventually, all of Sanuki Province was separated from Ehime into Kagawa
    Prefecture. The terrority was the same as in 1872. It's

    Buzen, Chikuzen). That historical importance as the center of the Bungo
    Province might be why Oita was picked. It might also be the larger amount of
    land to develop near Oita.

    After the merger with Kagoshima, the prefectural capital at Miyazaki became
    a government branch office. However, in 1877 the Satsuma rebellion (<ruby

    >) occurred. Due to being controlled by Kagoshima, Miyazaki saw quite a bit
    of fighting. A few years after the defeat of Kagoshima in the rebellion, the
    people of Miyazaki started the movement to split off from Kagoshima. One of
    the main reasons was the infairness in tax usage for schools and roads.

<h3 id="closing">Closing Thoughts</h3>
<p>
  While researching this information, I definitely learned a lot about the Meiji
  Restoration and early Meiji era Japan. I wasn't always able to find convincing
  answers to my original questions of
</p>
<ul>
  <li>
    What's the story behind the prefectural capital usually being same as the
    prefecture name?
  </li>
  <li>What were the reasons a city would be picked as a capital?</li>
  <li>What is the story behind the founding of the prefectures?</li>
</ul>
<p>
  However, in many cases I did find some good answers. I think my original
  assumption that the following factors would be important was mostly justified:
</p>
<ol>
  <li>Largest city in the prefecture at the time of founding</li>
  <li>Central location in the prefecture - For ease of transportation</li>
  <li>Historical "importance"</li>
</ol>
<p>
  In particular, the city size and historical "importance" seemed quite
  important. It was generally rare for prefectures to prioritize central
  location. For example, Wakayama, Nagano, and Tottori among others are all
  quite inconveniently located. Also, it definitely felt like the prefectures in
  western Japan were more considerate of various factors, but I suppose that's
  the benefit of being on the winning side of the Meiji Restoration.
</p>
<p>
  That said, it's not like centrality of location was never considered. I think
  one of the more interesting things is when a small city is picked as a
  prefectural capital and because of that becomes prosperous such as in Chiba
  and Miyazaki. It shows how important being chosen as a capital is. On the
  other hand, Fukushima city being only the 3rd in population in its prefecture
  shows how unimportant being a prefectural capital can be. On the note of
  Fukushima, one

    >recent</a

  news topic has been that the release of the waste water from the Fukushima
  nuclear plant led to an Aizu Ramen restaruant receiving spam calls. The choice
  of the Meiji leaders to merge Aizu into Fukushima in a way caused this ramen
  store owner's troubles. It goes to show how important the decisions of the
  Meiji Restoration are even in the modern day.
