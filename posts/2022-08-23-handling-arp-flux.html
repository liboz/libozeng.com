  Previously in
  <a href="./2022-08-02-monitoring-wifi.html"
    >my post about monitoring my home wifi</a
  >, I described using IPvlan to create an IP address for a docker image that
  was accessible throughout my network. One downside I noticed was that when I
  was <code>ssh</code>-ing into my Debian box, typing and inputting commands
  would become significantly laggier.
</p>

<p>
  I initially just dealt with the slowlness, but I finally got around to
  investigating it. After a number of missteps, I eventually came to the
  conclusion I needed to run the
  <code>arp -a</code> command on my main Windows machine. I found out that
  Debian box's Ethernet interface's IP (let's say its <i>192.168.1.59</i>) had
  the Debian box's Wifi interface's MAC address listed in the arp cache. So, I
  did the sensible thing and cleared my cache and forced another arping. Running
  the command again resulted in the Ethernet interface (<i>192.168.1.59</i>)
  having the Wifi interface's MAC address.
</p>

<p>
  By sending out manual ARP-Pings requesting the MAC address of
  <i>192.168.1.59</i>, I noticed that I got 3 responses for each ping I sent
  out. Two of them having the Wifi interface's MAC address and one with the
  Ethernet interface's MAC address. Googling around, I found out that this is
  called
  <a href="http://linux-ip.net/html/ether-arp.html#ether-arp-flux">ARP Flux</a>.
</p>

<p>
  Linux by default responds to the ARP ping to a known interface from all
  possible interfaces with the MAC address of the responding interface. Since my
  Debian box was connected via 3 interfaces (Ethernet, Wifi, Docker), it would
  only respond 3 times with only one response having the actual Ethernet MAC
  address. This would cause other machines to choose to connect via the slower
  Wifi interface and thus my <code>ssh</code> had much more latency.
</p>

  There are at least
  <a

    >two</a

  <a href="http://linux-ip.net/html/ether-arp.html#ether-arp-flux-arpfilter"
    >solutions</a
  >
  to this. I chose to put
</p>
<pre><code>net.ipv4.conf.default.arp_filter=1
net.ipv4.conf.all.arp_filter=1</code></pre>

<p>
  in my <code>/etc/sysctl.conf</code> file. Others preferred to put this instead
</p>

<pre><code>net.ipv4.conf.eth0.arp_ignore = 1
net.ipv4.conf.eth0.arp_announce = 2</code></pre>

<p>
  I suppose I trusted a book with the name of
  <i>Guide to IP Layer Network Administration with Linux</i> than other
  websites, but it's likely both work. Also the
  <a href="https://www.kernel.org/doc/Documentation/networking/ip-sysctl.txt"
    >documentation</a
  >
  for <code>arp_filter</code> seemed to cleanly express what I wanted:
</p>

<blockquote>
  1 - Allows you to have multiple network interfaces on the same subnet, and
  have the ARPs for each interface be answered based on whether or not the
  kernel would route a packet from the ARPâ€™d IP out that interface (therefore
  you must use source based routing for this to work). In other words it allows
  control of which cards (usually 1) will respond to an arp request.
</blockquote>

<p>
  The setting seemed to fix my lagginess with <code>ssh</code>. I confirmed by
  manually sending ARP Pings that I would only get a single reply to the correct
  Ethernet interface's MAC Address. Problem solved!
