<blurb>Benchmarking dotnet and golang</blurb>

<p>
  I've been making a fun app for personal enjoyment recently. I started with
  Python because it's easy to experiment with and it has a very nice and
  convenient standard library.
</p>

<p>
  However, unless you are using numpy or some other C based package, Python's
  performance for cpu based workloads tends to be not so great. The algorithm I
  cooked up for my app is cpu intensive and took ~5 seconds to run in python on
  my local desktop. That's suboptimal for something I want to do on demand from
  an API on the cloud, where the computing resources are going to much more
  limited. I decided to try my hand at rewriting my python algorithm in C#
  (dotnet core) and Golang.
</p>

<p>
  I've done a lot of programming in C# in the past, but haven't used it
  recently. I'm not very familiar with dotnet core, but recent performance
  numbers I've seen seem very promising. As for Golang, I've used it a bit
  recently so I have a little bit of familiarity, but definitely not in depth
  knowledge. I decided to use the Echo framework as that seemed to relatively
  speedy and simple enough to work with. I did some googling around for other
  frameworks, but I didn't encounter any major issues in Echo that made me want
  to try another framework. I've seen a large number of comments suggesting to
  not use a framework at all in Golang, but reimplementing a number of simple
  things like routing, automatic JSON handling, middleware, etc does not seem to
  be very valuable to me.
</p>
<p>
  For the sake of this post, I made a microbenchmark with similar
  characteristics to my actual algorithm. It involves involves reading a JSON
  request, looping on the data a number of times and using random numbers to
  make some decisions about the data before spitting out a JSON response.
  <a href="https://github.com/liboz/AppMicrobenchmark">Here's</a> the repo with
  the benchmark code. Some random things I learned/relearned while doing these
  benchmarks include:
</p>
<ul>
  <li>
    <i>System.Random</i> isn't threadsafe so we need to make a separate instance
    per thread
  </li>
  <li>
    Golang's <i>math/rand</i> is threadsafe, but contention among multiple
    threads results in bad performance. I noticed this thanks to easily being
    able to use <i>pprof</i> while running my algorithm in parallel.

    Echo's built in info about how long each request took was very nice. I wish
    ASP.NET had that built in

    Golang's docker images are truly miniscule at 4MB. My very small dotnet
    image is also not too shabby at 21MB. For comparison, some docker images at
    work with nodejs were breaking 2GB.

  My goal is to run a docker image on GCP's Cloud Run. Cloud Run has the nice
  feature of scaling to zero so it won't cost me anything if there's no usage.
  But first I wanted to test it locally. My desktop PC is going to have way
  better specs than the VMs I would get on a cloud provider, but it's a good
  point of reference. I used Apachebench and ran following command 3 times:
</p>

<div

    font-family: Menlo, Monaco, 'Courier New', monospace;
    padding: 10px;
  "
>
  ab -p benchmark.txt -T 'application/json' -n 5000 -c 100
  http://localhost:8080/benchmark
</div>

<p>Results:</p>

<p>
  It looks like Golang loses to dotnet by a little bit (12%) on average for
  request/second. It also doesn't do great in general until we get to the
  extremely high latency moments (maybe this is due to some GC in dotnet)
</p>

Of course, I want to see the performance on the cloud too. So I booted up a
cloud run service with the default settings (256MiB, 1vCPU, 80
request/container). I also tried bumping up the vCPU count to 2 as well as
bumping up the using 2vCPUs + 512MiB. Here are my results:
<div style="display: flex; overflow: scroll">
  <img src="assets/microbench-cloud-base.png" />
  <img src="assets/microbench-cloud-twocore.png" />
  <img src="assets/microbench-cloud-twocore-doublemem.png" />
</div>

<p>
  Again Golang beats dotnet at the 99%-tile (maybe this is GC or cold start?).
  Surprisingly, unlike locally, Golang does better across the board especially
  on the smallest machine type where the average of 511ms is 33% faster than
  dotnet's 681ms average. Golang's performance advantage decreases as the
  resources increase to the point where with double mem + double cores they are
  basically the same on average. Ideally, I want to be able to use the lowest
  spec machines possible to reduce any costs so superior performance on those
  minimal machines is quite attractive.
</p>

<p>
  That was a nice exercise, but here are some numbers from my actual algorithm
  running on the base specs available on cloud run.
</p>

<p>
  The same kind of trends continue with the dotnet version being marginally
  worse on the 50%-tile response times and much worse at 99%-tile response
  times. Golang was 35% faster on average than dotnet. I didn't measure memory
  usage on the cloud, but just vaguely looking at Task Manager while my program
  was executing indicate that Golang was using 20mb or so of memory vs 200mb of
  memory from dotnet. That's also quite impressive.
</p>

<p>Conclusions</p>
<ul>
  <li>
    After reading all the news about dotnet's performance gains, I do see that
    with better machines it seems to match Golang's performance. However, it's
    definitely not as lightweight as Golang and it's 99%-tile response times in
    particular are not inspiring
  </li>
  <li>
    Profiling was really easy in Golang and built in. However, even using some
    commercial profilers in dotnet didn't really give me any clues as to what
    was the reasons for some slowness. Maybe I didn't set them up properly or
    perhaps they aren't so great with static methods...
  </li>
  <li>
    Cloud Run is pretty impressive and the free tier is super generous. I didn't
    heavily measure cold starts as that's more difficult to set up, but on some
    basic tests golang was much better than dotnet (300ms vs 3.5s).
  </li>
</ul>
